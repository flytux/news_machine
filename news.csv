0,"Cloudflare  decided to use April Fool’s Day (4/1) to share some news about four 1’s that could help speed your internet browsing. The company announced today that it’s launching a DNS service for consumers called 1.1.1.1
The company’s tool — which is not some super nerdy April Fool’s joke — will allow users to shorten load times of web pages and keep some data away from network providers. Cloudfare boasts it will be “the Internet’s fastest, privacy-first consumer DNS service.”
In layman’s terms, by punching the number 1 four times into their DNS network info, consumers can hand over the reigns over to Cloudflare to connect a URL that they type into the tool bar — say, techcrunch.com — with that site’s IP address, a process that’s done by making requests to the Domain Name System (DNS). If you go to 1.1.1.1, you’ll get some info on how to enable this on the device that you’re on.
It’s completely separate from the startup’s authoritative DNS service for its customers but it does take advantage of Cloudflare’s existing network to provide the fastest speeds possible to users, shaving off milliseconds from other service like Google’s Public DNS Service.
It’s important to note that this DNS service isn’t some magical catch-all, you’re still much better off operating a VPN if you don’t want any of your web activity being exposed. One of the main use cases that the company seems to be tackling here is how governments have used DNS to get network providers to censor citizens access to the web.
“[I]t’s been depressing to us to watch all too frequently how DNS can be used as a tool of censorship against many of the groups we protect. While we’re good at stopping cyber attacks, if a consumer’s DNS gets blocked there’s been nothing we could do to help,” Prince said in blog post.
The company says that the new service will help keep some data out of ISPs’ hands and that they won’t keep data in their hands for long either. Cloudflare has pledged to both never write users’ IP addresses to disk and that they’ll purge all logs from their system after 24 hours. CEO Matthew Prince doesn’t want you taking their word for it though, he detailed in a blog that the company has paid for an independent audit firm to take a look at their code annually and ensure that they’ve been doing this.
Cloudflare has always seemed to prioritize securing a healthy future for the internet, that’s led it into some tough predicaments with like Nazis and stuff, with this latest launch it seems that the company is trying to enact some positive changes for promoting privacy and speed on the consumer side.",Cloudflare decided to use April Fool&#8217;s Day (4/1) to share some news about four 1&#8217;s that could help speed your internet browsing.

At this month’s WWDC, Apple unveiled refined accessibility tools
The pleasure and the pain of the accessible smart home



From an accessibility news standpoint, this week’s Apple event in Chicago was antithetical to the October 2016 event. At the latter event, Apple  began the presentation with a bang — showing the actual video being edited using Switch Control in Final Cut. Tim Cook came out afterwards to talk some about Apple’s commitment to serving the disabled community before unveiling the then-new accessibility page on the company’s website.

By contrast, the education-themed event in Chicago  this week went by with barely a mention of accessibility. The only specific call-out came during Greg Joswiak’s time on stage talking about iPad, when he said “accessibility features make iPad a learning tool for everyone.”
That doesn’t mean, however, accessibility has no relevance to what was announced.
I was in the audience at Lane Tech College Prep on Tuesday covering the event. As a former special educator –and special education student — I watched with keen interest as Apple told their story around education. While Apple is targeting the mainstream, I came away with strong impressions on how Apple can make serious inroads in furthering special education as well.
It’s Called ‘Special’ for a Reason
Apple is obviously—rightfully—building their educational strategy towards mainstream students in mainstream classes. It’s a classic top-down approach: Teachers assign students work via handouts, for such activities as writing essays or completing science projects. This is the entire reason for Apple’s Classroom and Schoolwork apps. However well-designed, they lack an element.
Where they lack is there is nothing afforded, at least in specific terms, to teachers and students in special education settings. Apple’s strategy here is defined, again, by the classic teacher-student relationship, without any regard for other models. I’m not levying a criticism on the company; this is the reality.
At many levels, special education classrooms do not function in a way that’s conducive to Apple’s vision for learning at this time. In the moderate-to-severe early childhood (Pre-K) classrooms I worked in for close to a decade, the structure was such that most, if not all, activities were augmented by a heavy dose of adult support. Furthermore, most of our students were pulled out of class at certain times for additional services such as speech services and physical/occupational therapy sessions.
In short, there were no lectures or essay prompts anywhere.
This is where accessibility comes in. There is enormous potential for Apple to dig deeper and expand the toolset they offer to educators and students. To accommodate for special education is, in my view, akin to accommodating disabled users by offering accessibility features on each of Apple’s software platforms.
Special education is special for a reason. It involves ways of teaching and learning that are unique, and the people who work and learn in these environments deserve the same consideration.
Accessibility is Apple’s Secret Weapon
Leading up to the event, there was much talk in the Apple community of writers and podcasters that Google  is eating Apple’s lunch in the schools market because Chromebooks are dirt cheap for districts and most everyone relies on Google Docs.
I’m not interested in the particulars of this argument. What I am interested in, however, is simply pointing out that despite the perception Apple products are too expensive and less capable, they are better in one meaningful sense: accessibility.
Consider Chromebook versus iPad. In many levels of special education, an iPad is far superior to a Chromebook. The tablet’s multi-touch user interface is far more intuitive, and more importantly, iOS is built with accessibility in mind. From VoiceOver to Dynamic Type to Switch Control and more, an iPad (or an iPod Touch, for that matter) can provide a far more accessible and enriching learning experience for many students with disabilities than a Chromebook. And lest we forget the App Store effect; there are many outstanding apps geared for special ed.
This is a crucial point that many technology pundits who lament Apple’s position in the education market always seem to miss.
Making Special Educators More Special
One area where Apple can greatly improve the lives of teachers is by broadening the Schoolwork app such that it makes IEP prep easier and, playing to Apple’s core strength, more modern. Historically, even today, IEPs are planned and written using stacks of paperwork. Goals, assessments, and consent forms are handwritten (sometimes typed) and stapled together. And being a binding legal document, teachers must ensure there are the proper signatures on every page, or else be dinged for being out of compliance with protocols. In sum: the IEP is the bane of every special educator’s existence because they take so much time.
To this end, Apple could do special education teachers a grand service by adding a module of sorts to its Schoolwork app that would allow them to more easily create and track a student’s IEP. There could be charts for tracking goal progress, as well as ways to collate and distribute documents amongst the IEP team (SLPs, OT/PT, etc) and of course parents. Teachers could even send an email to parents with any consent forms attached and encourage them to sign with Apple Pencil on their iPad, if they have one.
At the very least, it would make IEP prep infinitely more efficient, and perhaps alleviate some of the stress at the actual meetings. Digitizing the process would be game-changing, I think.
Bottom Line
The ideas I’ve outlined here are well within Apple’s wheelhouse. They would likely need to collaborate with special educators and districts on things like IEP forms and policies, but it is certainly within them to do so. They can do this if they want.
To reiterate an earlier point, special education deserves just as much thoughtful consideration and innovation as the education industry at large. Given Apple’s unwavering support of accessibility, this is an area in which they can surely improve.","Steven Aquino Contributor Share on Twitter Steven Aquino is a freelance tech writer and iOS accessibility expert.

2,"What goes up must come down. That’s generally the rule, anyway, certainly for spacecraft that have fulfilled their purpose and have no way to stay in orbit. Such is the case of Tiangong-1, China’s first space station, which after nearly 7 years in space is making an uncontrolled descent and should provide a nice fiery light show in the skies over… somewhere.
Because there are so many unknowns about Tiangong-1’s trajectory, observers can only give an educated guess. The only thing they’re pretty sure about is that it’s going to drop some time in the next 24 hours — probably sometime tonight, and somewhere between 43 degrees north and 43 degrees south.
But owing to the speeds involved and the inherently unpredictable nature of how a large body will tumble through the atmosphere, the exact time and location won’t be known basically until the event occurs. “At no time will a precise time/location prediction from ESA be possible,” explained reentry experts at the European Space Agency.
That sounds quite dire, but it isn’t.

Sure, Tiangong-1 is about the size of a schoolbus and weighs 9.4 tons, but unlike a meteorite of that size the station is hollow and fragile, and should break apart completely during its descent. There’s no danger, experts insist. No one is on board the station and it isn’t on a collision course with any crewed craft.
It may seem a little crazy, but burning up in the atmosphere is just a part of the natural life cycle of large spacecraft. This one isn’t even that big.
Tiangong-1 (the name roughly translates to “Heavenly Palace”) was launched in late 2011 in two parts, which connected in space — the first such feat accomplished by China’s space program. Over the next two years, three spacecraft docked with the newly formed station: one robotic craft, Shenzhou-8, and two crewed missions, Shenzhou-9 and 10, each with three on board.
These missions proved the viability of China’s space station tech (another test platform, Tiangong-2, was launched in 2016), and in 2013 Tiangong-1, having accomplished what its creators set out to do, was deactivated. Its creators planned to have it execute a controlled descent at some point, using its thrusters to put it on a path to break up over the ocean.
As little risk as there may be of debris hitting someone, it’s good practice not to take that risk if you don’t have to, and good manners not to dispose of your space junk over someone else’s country.
A helpful visualization of the expected debris footprint of Tiangong-1 from The Aerospace Corporation.
Unfortunately, the spacecraft stopped responding to its handlers in China about two years ago, meaning that a controlled descent was no longer possible. As a result, Tiangong-1’s orbit has decayed naturally and it’s only in the last few months that it’s become clear when it would come down.
Because we have no telemetry from the station, we only know what we can observe from outside the station (like Fraunhofer’s radar imagery, shown above), and a host of variables make it difficult to say anything with certainty. It wasn’t until this week that its deorbit path has become clear enough that space authorities are confident giving even a 24-hour window when it will come down.
Those on the ground there may possibly be treated to a “splendid” light show, as China’s space agency put it, as if a large meteor is breaking up in the upper atmosphere. It should be visible for a minute or so as the station tumbles and breaks up and its constituent pieces burn.
Predictions may get slightly better depending on observations, so I’ll update this post if the window is significantly altered.","What goes up must come down.

It’s like Tinder for finding your role model and dream career in science, technology, engineering, art or math, STEAMRole founder and CEO Clarence Wooten told me.
“As the saying goes, you can’t be what you can’t see,” Wooten said.
Similar to Snapchat’s story functionality, students and aspiring professionals can consume inspirational content from role models. For role models, they can post about how their backgrounds, the work they do and how they landed their dream job.

4,"The Defense Department’s research wing is serious about putting drones into action, not just one by one but in coordinated swarms. The Offensive Swarm-Enabled Tactics program is kicking off its second “sprint,” a period of solicitation and rapid prototyping of systems based around a central theme. This spring sprint is all about “autonomy.”
The idea is to collect lots of ideas on how new technology, be it sensors, software, or better propeller blades, can enhance the ability of drones to coordinate and operate as a collective.
Specifically, swarms of 50 will need to “isolate an urban objective” within half an hour or so by working together with each other and ground-based robot. That at least is the “operational backdrop” that should guide prospective entrants in their decision whether their tech is applicable.
So a swarm of drones that seed a field faster than a tractor, while practical for farmers, isn’t really something the Pentagon is interested in here. On the other hand, if you can sell that idea as a swarm of drones dropping autonomous sensors on an urban battlefield, they might take a shine to it.
But you could also simply demonstrate how using a compact ground-based lidar system could improve swarm coordination at low cost and without using visible light. Or maybe you’ve designed a midair charging system that lets a swarm perk up flagging units without human intervention.
Those are pretty good ideas, actually — maybe I’ll run them by the program manager, Timothy Chung, when he’s on stage at our Robotics event in Berkeley this May. Chung also oversees the Subterranean Challenge and plenty more at DARPA . He looks like he’s having a good time in the video explaining the ground rules of this new sprint:

You don’t have to actually have 50 drones to take part — there are simulators and other ways of demonstrating value. More information on the program and how to submit your work for consideration can be found at the FBO page.","The Defense Department's research wing is serious about putting drones into action, not just one by one but in coordinated swarms.

5,"There’s money, and then there’s wealth. In all likelihood, money is what most of us have (or don’t have). It’s what we use to buy lunch, pay rent or put a down payment on a house. Wealth, on the other hand, is what buys yachts. But more than superficial material things, wealth also buys financial security (and all the good and ill that comes with it) for subsequent generations.
What is a family office?
Although close to half of Americans hold no stocks, bonds or real estate, most of the remaining half that are lucky and prosperous enough to do so choose to manage their assets on their own, or perhaps with the help of a financial advisor. But as you move further along the privileged end of the socio-economic curve, managing, preserving and growing one’s wealth becomes more complicated.
Many of the world’s highest-net-worth (HNW) families employ an entire office full of accountants, lawyers and investment professionals to manage their assets. These “family offices” sometimes manage the assets of more than one family, but they are still relatively close-knit.
Historically, family offices haven’t made many direct investments into individual tech startups, instead favoring a more diversified approach to tech investing by being limited partners in venture capital and other private-market funds. Or, outside of tech, they invest in public-market equities, real estate, fixed income or other “alternative” asset classes besides VC, PE and hedge funds, according to a 2017 article about ultra HNW investors’ portfolios from KKR.
Increasingly, however, family offices are investing more into individual tech startups, at least according to anecdotal reports and a recent funding round Crunchbase News covered. But one anecdote doesn’t document a trend, so let’s take a look at the numbers.
Family offices’ direct investment into startups picked up the pace
Data covering direct startup investments from family offices listed in Crunchbase bears out that trend. The chart below is based on more than 1,700 venture deals (seed, angel, equity crowdfunding, Series A, Series B, etc.) struck with individual technology companies by 193 family offices located around the world.

The 193 family offices with listed venture investments are, no doubt, only a fraction of the total count of such groups, which tend to be private. Combined with the fact that many startups are slow to announce funding, it’s not like the list of funding rounds or their participants is comprehensive. However, assuming it’s fairly representative, we can treat the figure above as a directional indicator of general trends.
And what are those trends?
First off, at least when it comes to deal volume, family offices’ startup investment activity tracks with the broader venture investment market (which includes individual angels, venture capital groups, seed funds, accelerators and others).
During the several years leading up to 2015, there was a run-up in the number of deals being struck. After that high point, though, deal volume began to decline in the U.S., which Crunchbase News has documented, as investors eschewed writing many smaller checks to early-stage startups, instead favoring fewer, larger checks with later-stage tech companies. On a global scale, projected deal volume is roughly flat on an annualized basis from 2015 through 2017, whereas reported deal data is down primarily due to reporting delays. Because there are more U.S. family offices that invest in startups than international ones, it’s not surprising to see that family office deal volume hews closer to the U.S. market in general.
Family office venture deal volume growth outpaced VC
But what’s different about family offices — and what lends credence to the anecdotal evidence suggesting there are more family offices investing in more startups — is the growth rate in deal volume over time as compared to institutional venture capital investors. To be sure, worldwide, there were more deals struck by both types of investor in 2017 than in 2010 (even when accounting for reporting delays). But the difference between these two types of investor is in the magnitude of the change.
In the chart below, we compare reported deal volume between VC funds (which have a lot of known deals per year) and family offices (which, as we showed above, have much fewer recorded startup investment deals per year). We adjust for this discrepancy in deal volume by indexing reported deal volume against 2010 levels. In doing so, we’re able to deliver a relativistic, apples-to-apples comparison between the two.

Worldwide, in 2015, reported deal volume from VC firms was almost precisely 2.5x that of 2010’s totals. But that multiple for family offices is roughly 6x. And, although it isn’t pictured above, family office deal volume growth outperformed traditional VC between 2011-2017, 2012-2017 and 2013-2017.
In relative terms, across a range of measures, deal volume growth was higher and faster among family offices than VC funds for a significant period of time. The data suggest that family offices making direct investments into startups recently became a trend. Especially for that period through 2014, family offices were on the early side of the adoption curve for making direct startup investments. Whatever growth we see on the VC side is the product of growth in the market in general, but it’s not like VC funds are still adopting direct startup investments into their repertoire. It’s been their model for decades. For comparatively stodgy family offices, it was still the new, new thing.","There’s money, and then there’s wealth.

6,"First things first: I had a really good time watching Ready Player One. As promised, the movie feels like a chance for Steven Spielberg  to return to his roots as a blockbuster filmmaker, and to take all the toys out of the box and smash them together.
The film is based on Ernest Cline’s bestselling novel, with a script by Cline and Zak Penn. It’s ostensibly set in Columbus, Ohio, 30 years in the future, in a world overwhelmed by climate change and overpopulation. But Ready Player One‘s real setting is the OASIS, an enormous virtual reality world.
The story’s hero is Wade Watts (played by Tye Sheridan), who spends most of his time in the OASIS, hoping to complete three challenges  left behind by James Halliday, the technology’s inventor. Halliday has promised that the first person to complete the challenges will gain control of the OASIS.
The film’s central achievement is bringing this virtual world to life. Rather than aiming for a photo-real effect, Spielberg has embraced the OASIS’ essentially cartoony and video game-like qualities, and after a few minutes of acclimation, I had no problem jumping back-and-forth between the movie’s digital free-for-all and its live action dystopia.

It’s clear that the characters take what happens in the OASIS as seriously as anything in the “real world,” and that they see their virtual avatars as an extension or expression of their real selves, so I was happy to follow their lead.
And as Who Framed Roger Rabbit? and Wreck-it Ralph have already shown, there can be something exhilarating about seeing elements from classic films and video games thrown together. I genuinely felt like I was 10 years old again as I watched the first big set piece, with Wade racing through the streets of New York City in his Back to the Future-style DeLorean, dodging King Kong and the Tyrannosaurus from Jurassic Park.
But I also felt a rapidly growing sense of diminishing returns.
True, Spielberg and other directors of his generation have openly borrowed from old movies throughout their careers. Raiders of the Lost Ark and Star Wars were inspired by the pop culture that Spielberg and his friend George Lucas loved as kids, but those movies transformed what had come before into something new.

There’s nothing quite as magical here. At its worst, Ready Player One amounts to little more than a game of spot-the-reference. And even at its best, any excitement feels more like a rapidly fading sugar rush, not the indelible thrill of Spielberg’s best work.
He’s has been happy to talk about Ready Player One as a return to making movies “from the audience, for the audience,” but Spielberg’s also suggested that he has more on his mind than pure entertainment — that the film is meant to highlight some of the ways that the Internet and virtual reality could be used to isolate us, to distract from the world’s very real problems.
Some of that comes across in the film’s opening moments, when Wade climbs down a tower of rundown trailers. Inside each one, we can see that his neighbors are all hidden behind goggles, living in their own fantasies.
But despite a few pious nods towards the importance of the real world, the film doesn’t seem very interested in the flaws of the OASIS — or the dark side of the nostalgic fan culture that Wade embodies. Sure, Wade has a hard time to talking to girls, but it’s clear that when he confronts the film’s villain (a corporate executive who could never love John Hughes movies the way Wade does), we’re meant to see cheer him on as he declares, “A fanboy knows a hater.”

And while Mark Rylance delivers the film’s most compelling performance as Halliday, the script falls short. By portraying the most powerful technologist in the world as a lonely, awkward but ultimately benign and Willy Wonka-ish figure, it feels strangely out-of-sync with 2018, when everyone seems to be wrestling with the damage that these digital platforms may be doing.
And yet … I had a good time. I felt plenty of reservations as I left the theater, but I made my peace with them by accepting Ready Player One as the ultimate expression of geek nostalgia, with all the virtues and the limitations that implies.
I suspect Spielberg and Cline have taken us as far down the pop culture rabbit hole as any movie can go. Hopefully, other filmmakers will realize that, and they’ll look elsewhere for inspiration.","First things first: I had a really good time watching Ready Player One.

Think you’ve heard that song before? Were there more Jennifer’s or Jessica’s in your class at school? And what does this have to do with the rise of Donald Trump?
In the latest episode of the Interesting People in Interesting Times podcast, Derek Thompson, author of Hitmakers: The Science of Popularity in an Age of Distraction, explains what influences our thinking, drives our choices, and ultimately dictates human behavior.
Thompson argues that patterns and predictability are the essence of human life. What makes a hit song, a winning politician, a bestselling product, and even a successful tech startup, comes down to repetition. 
At the core of Thompson’s theory is the myth of novelty: We seemingly love to discover new things, but they only resonate with us if they’re grounded in an element of familiarity.
“We live in a culture where there’s enormous pressure to be aware of and to like new things, to be aware of new songs, to see new movies, to read new books, to seek out new ideas, to be up on the hottest fashion or the most salacious thing happening on Twitter,” Thompson says. “Yet the most fundamental finding from psychology is that people do not like new things. The [concept of] the mere-exposure effect says that the mere exposure to any stimulus to us biases us towards that stimulus: we are suckers for the familiar.”
“Take movies. We love to see new movies. That said, every year this century, a majority of the top 10 films in America have been sequels, adaptations, or reboots. This is even true in the landscape of ideas. It’s thrilling and wonderful to read a brilliant essay but what we love and pass on the most is those essays that have a clever joke or framing device to tell us that that thing we believe in is in fact true.” 
The reason we fall for certain people and products comes down to “familiar surprises: ideas that strike us as original when we confront them, but in investigating them, it’s like stepping through a door and seeing an old friend on the inside. Discovering a feeling of familiarity within products and discovering a-ha moments is what all consumers are looking for throughout the cultural landscape.” 
In politics, Thompson says, “We love new faces. But we only fall for them when they tell us familiar stories.” For example, “Make America Great Again is not only the most traditional thing you could possibly say, but it’s so traditional, Ronald Reagan said it 28 years ago.”
“For a long period of time, elites could use scarce media channels like radio to dictate taste to consumers, and consumers through sheer repetition and familiarity bias would lap up the ideas of the elites. Taste was top-down for most of history, but now it’s bottom-up.”
What does that have to do with Donald Trump?
The dominant theory in political science about elections was called “the party decides” — voters don’t decide who becomes the presidential nominee of any particular party. The party decides. The party equals the elites. The exact same phenomenon that’s happening in music, is happening in politics. But now, you have this explosion in the channels of exposure.
“Taste in politics, just like taste in music, has gone from being dictated top down to where it bubbles up. Across the cultural landscape, taste itself is becoming more chaotic, harder to predict, harder to control.”
Turns out, the structure of making a hit song, and its devices, like repetition, are key to political speechwriting, as well as marketing.
The most famous line in speech making in the 20th century is John F. Kennedy’s “Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country.” Mark Twain said “It’s not the size of the dog in the fight, it’s the size of the fight in the dog.” Hillary Clinton’s  perhaps most well-known line is: “Human rights are women’s rights, and women’s rights are human rights.”  
“The reason this is so common in speechwriting, so clever and so powerful, is that it turns ideas into music through repetition. It takes any concept and musicalizes it so that our brain falls in love with the music before it even has time to process the substance.”
And here’s where this connects to Andrew Yang, who is running for President in 2020, as featured in the first episode of the IPIT podcast.< According to Thompson, “Andrew Yang is selling a huge proposal with Universal Basic Income. And he’s selling it based on a rather large, scary principle: that our jobs are going away in way that’s never happened before. I think it’s important for politicians to have huge visions, particularly when those visions are based in an element of morality. I would urge him however to find more ways to fit the concept of a freedom dividend within the system that we have, by suggesting, for example, that he’s open to doubling or tripling the income tax credit. Or by suggesting that he’s willing to expand Medicare maybe from 65 to 55 and even to 45, and that he has plans to expand Medicaid as well. I think that having an element of radical idealism is really really important for running for president. But it’s important that we ground our visions of radicalism to an element of familiarity, because politics, like music, is a popularizing business. Running for president is essentially the largest popularity contest in the U.S. And we know people are afraid of ideas that sound too radical.”
The takeaway here is: “Dream as big as possible, but just as it’s important to sell something familiar by making it surprising, if you’re trying to sell something surprising, do remember to make it familiar.”

8,"The team behind the popular open-source CMS Drupal is urging admins to update their sites to ward off a nasty bug that could leave their sites “highly compromised” to attackers, according to the organization.
The effected versions (Drupal  6, 7 and 8) of the CMS power over one million websites on the internet.
Drupal has marked the security risk as “highly critical” and warns that any visitor to the site could theoretically hack it through remote code execution due to a missing input validation.
“This potentially allows attackers to exploit multiple attack vectors on a Drupal site, which could result in the site being completely compromised,” the group noted in a blog post.
Drupal sent out an alert last week, telling users that they’d be dropping a “highly critical release” this weekend and they should update immediately. The announcement was unusual for Drupal and left developers on high alert for the targeted time frame of the release on Friday. Sites running vulnerable versions of Drupal, should update to Drupal 7.58 or Drupal 8.5.1 as soon as possible to avoid exploits. Drupal notes that they have yet to see any reports of exploits in the wild yet.
The bug’s official identifier is CVE-2018-7600 though users on social media have taken to calling it drupalgeddon2, referencing another major release from the org in 2014.","The team behind the popular open-source CMS Drupal is urging admins to update their sites to ward off a nasty bug that could leave their sites &#8220;highly compromised&#8221; to attackers, according to the organization.

10,"Generals are famously always “studying how to fight the last war,” with the last war’s technology, while dismissing how the world and its tech have changed in the interim. This is true for dissidents, rebels, and culture wars too. Our fears tend to be of 20th century boogeymen, the Nazis and the Soviet Union — but we should be worrying about other things entirely. The world and its dystopias have moved on.
The Nazis and the Soviets obviously inspired Orwell’s “1984,” which was stunning, visionary, and enormously influential … while still being slightly myopic compared to Huxley’s earlier, much weirder, and much more subversive “Brave New World.” But Orwell too was already able to prophesy a world in which no one really fought for territory any more. What would be the point?
Militaries around the world are constructed primarily for national defense against an invading, conquering force, but invading and conquering territory makes no sense any more. Wealth and power are no longer remotely related to how much real estate or raw materials you control. South Korea’s US-dollar GDP is higher than that of Russia.
The US swept Iraq’s military away like gauze paper when they invaded in 2003, but it turns out that, even after you overthrow a brutal dictator, even when it’s one of the most oil-rich nations on the planet, attempting to occupy and control a hostile nation inevitably becomes a horribly expensive catastrophe that costs enormously more than any possible benefits.
Nation-states don’t invade and conquer each other any more because of military defenses, or any kind of Pax Americana, or because everyone has gotten nicer and kinder over the last hundred years. They don’t do it because, thanks to technology-driven transformations over that time, it simply doesn’t make any sense; in fact it has become complete madness.
Similarly, counterculture individualists and lovers of freedom worry about Nazi fascism or Soviet police states. How twentieth century of us. There are plenty of neo-fascists out there, to my dismay, and we often seem to be doing our best to accidentally construct the tools of a police state out of modern technology — smartphones, drones, facial recognition technology, etc. in the much-abused name of “security.” I’m certainly not suggesting that people or societies today are somehow less likely to construct such horrors because they have grown morally better over time. There are plenty of awful people out there.
I am, however, suggesting that awful people today are a lot less likely to aim for fascism or totalitarianism because awful people benefit a lot less from those systems than they used to. The Soviet Union collapsed because it was an economic disaster as well as a moral one. The closest things we have to fascist states today — monarchies like North Korea and Saudi Arabia — are fragile, riven by internal contradictions and internecine warfare, facing the future with desperation and fear.
There’s a new playbook for oppression today. Instead of outright totalitarian rule, you construct the appearance of democracy, while controlling it by subtly — in some cases perhaps not even consciously — restricting the options available to individual voters; by controlling a tiered system of “representative” electors behind the scenes; or by simply outright stuffing the ballot box. (There can be much sound and fury about the distinctions between the available candidates, but if you’ve done your job correctly, and made democracy as awful as possible, in general only establishment candidates or easily manipulated narcissists will ever be nominated.)
Then you give your people enough freedom to thrive; to create, to disrupt, to innovate. And you siphon as much as you can of that created wealth.
You don’t give them enough to actually seriously challenge the establishment, of course; to, say, remake the system so that the siphoned wealth goes to its poor and oppressed people instead of its silent, invisible masters. That is a red line that must not be crossed. But the beauties of this system — call it parasitism — is that it is very rare to encounter a challenger who cannot be co-opted. It vampire-squids enough wealth for its upper-tier members and their families to live lives of extraordinary, gilded luxury, without the unpleasant threat of being assassinated or deposed that comes with outright fascism or totalitarianism.
These parasitic systems couldn’t exist without today’s technology. They are mostly networked, not hierarchical. They watch, they adapt, and they distract. They construct shell corporations that shuttle gobs of money around the globe like 747s. And they very rarely need to resort to violence, because, like the Borg, and like capitalism itself — from which it is distinct, although there are places where it has been so successful that people rarely recognize any difference — parasitism usually has the capacity to absorb all those who confront it.
I’m not saying fascism and totalitarianism are things we should be completely unworried about. They’re out there, they’re real, and they’re terrifying. But there are playbooks for how to fight them. Parasitism, though, seems almost unstoppable. Presumably the solution is a technological one; let’s hope it’s discovered soon.","Generals are famously always &#8220;studying how to fight the last war,&#8221; with the last war&#8217;s technology, while dismissing how the world and its tech have changed in the interim.

11,"How many second acts can a startup have before its procession of unlikely pirouettes must raise more than a quizzical eyebrow?
It depends where you’re asking the question of course.
And as we sit here, contemplating the smooth-faced Krablr founder, Wilson Poney, gazing out at the Pacific ice blue from inside his underwater glass cube, it’s clear this company hasn’t had any such clouds of doubt fogging its public trajectory.
A large Sea Nettle wafts past Poney’s head, pausing momentarily to lend him a gelatinous hairpiece.
He breathes in with vast calm.
“We’re going to run the biggest token sale in blockchain history,” he announces. “We connect crab to the blockchain. Period.
“You read the whitepaper right? Bona fide golden ticket. You want to be cut in? I could pull some strings if you’re keen but you’ll need at least $100k for phase I. We’ll be going up 100x or more in later rounds. We’re not after tiddlers or hodlers or whatever they’re called. Just top tier investment funds.
“Okay, okay, a few family offices in Saudi, Qatar — and Puget and Scranton. Gotta keep our little local connection happy.”
He laughs a little too heartily.
“We’ve also been talking to SoftBank. Masayoshi might join the board. He’s very interested in the long term future of crab futures.”
Poney has the face of a man who’s eaten more than his fair share of crab dinners.
But he cuts into our next question — about how much Krablr  is targeting for its token sale — to bark into a lobster-handled landline telephone, summoning an afternoon snack.
Is that an original Dalí, your correspondent wonders. Poney ignores all our questions.
“How do I know these crab sticks are going to be fucking great? Blockchain that’s how. It’s a fucking miracle.
“People have been emailing me saying they’re selling their grandmothers to get into KrabCoin,” he adds. “Fucking A-Okay. As I always told grammy, nothing beats the smell of capitalism in the morning.”
He takes a huge sniff of his own air.
“All the time actually. It smells like fresh cooked crab. Maybe that’s just me. My girlfriend thinks capitalism smells like diamonds — but that was after I gave her a 22 carat diamond necklace. I had the rock cut into the shape of a carapace.”
He flashes a full set of brilliantly pearly teeth.
“Anyway, where was I? — blockchain! Did you see my number plate? There’s only one car parking space here. Y’know how it is with land in the Bay. But I don’t mind telling you this office was cheaper than Fresno. Marine mid shallows is actually a criminally untapped opportunity. We’re going to be using a chunk of the ICO to plough into underwater real estate. Think Manhattan in an aquarium with underwater drones to ferry you home and jellyfish waving you to beddie byes. I can send you the brochure if you’re interested.
“Anyway the lobster-colored lambo in the lot is mine. Did you notice the plate? It’s the timestamp of Satoshi’s Genesis block. I paid a small fortune to some guy in the Mission to peel it off his electric scooter. I’d have happily paid twice.
“People are going to say I’m fucking Satoshi himself soon!”
Poney ejects another ripe belly laugh. Or it might have been a belch. His assistant hurries into the room carrying a large platter of crab sticks.
“At last! I could murder a bucket of lobster! Help yourself to the shrimp. It’s blockchain certified.”
So why did Krablr move its HQ to SF? Was it to be closer to Pacific crab catches?
Poney pauses his vigorous mastication for a moment. “How much crab is left in the Pacific?” he muses. “No one knows. Truly no one. But they will know — we’ll be putting all that on the blockchain.
“Frankly I’d put my grammy on the blockchain if I could. You can quote me on that.”
He grins wolfishly through a mouthful of crabs sticks and then laughs with gusto, blasting the room with fragments of impossibly fresh crab meat.
“Pot baits, carapace metrics, poundage, sex distribution, discards, toss backs, deadloss, offload times,” he reels off, staccato style, after his last gulp. “You’ll know exactly how many deckhands manhandled your dinner. Down to the color of their fucking fingernails.
“Now tell me that’s not worth $1TR?”
“Here, take a claw,” he adds, tossing a souvenir of his snack towards the door without waiting for an answer. “You can tell your friends you got yourself a bite of KrabCoin.”","How many second acts can a startup have before its procession of unlikely pirouettes must raise more than a quizzical eyebrow?

12,"Facebook  is scrambling to add safeguards against abuse of user data as it reels from backlash over the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Now TechCrunch has learned Facebook will launch a certification tool that demands that marketers guarantee email addresses used for ad targeting were rightfully attained. This new Custom Audiences certification tool was described by Facebook representatives to their marketing clients, according to two sources. Facebook will also prevent the sharing of Custom Audience data across Business accounts. 
This snippet of a message sent by a Facebook rep to a client notes that “for any Custom Audiences data imported into Facebook, Advertisers will be required to represent and warrant that proper user content has been obtained.” 
Once shown the message, Facebook spokesperson Elisabeth Diana told TechCrunch “I can confirm there is a permissions tool that we’re building.” It will require that advertisers and the agencies representing them pledge that “I certify that I have permission to use this data”, she said.
Diana noted that “We’ve always had terms in place to ensure that advertisers have consent for data they use but we’re going to make that much more prominent and educate advertisers on the way they can use the data.” The change isn’t in response to a specific incident, but Facebook does plan to re-review the way it works with third-party data measurement firms to ensure everything is responsibly used. This is a way to safeguard data” Diana concluded.The company declined to specify whether it’s ever blocked usage of a Custom Audience because it suspected the owner didn’t have user consent. ”
The social network is hoping to prevent further misuse of ill-gotten data after Dr. Aleksandr Kogan’s app that pulled data on 50 million Facebook users was passed to Cambridge Analytica  in violation of Facebook policy. That sordid data is suspected to have been used by Cambridge Analytica to support the Trump and Brexit campaigns, which employed Custom Audiences to reach voters.

Facebook launched Custom Audiences back in 2012 to let businesses upload hashed lists of their customers email addresses or phone numbers, allowing advertisers to target specific people instead of broad demographics. Custom Audiences quickly became one of Facebook’s most powerful advertising options because businesses could easily reach existing customers to drive repeat sales. The Custom Audiences terms of service require that businesses have “provided appropriate notice to and secured any necessary consent from the data subjects” to attain and use these people’s contact info.
But just like Facebook’s policy told app developers like Kogan not to sell, share, or misuse data they collected from Facebook users, the company didn’t go further to enforce this rule. It essentially trusted that the fear of legal repercussions or suspension on Facebook would deter violations of both its app data privacy and Custom Audiences consent policies. With clear financial incentives to bend or break those rules and limited effort spent investigating to ensure compliance, Facebook left itself and its users open to exploitation.
Last week Facebook banned the use of third-party data brokers like Experian and Acxiom for ad targeting, closing a marketing featured called Partner Categories. Facebook is believed to have been trying to prevent any ill-gotten data from being laundered through these data brokers and then directly imported to Facebook to target users. But that left open the option for businesses to compile illicit data sets or pull them from data brokers, then upload them to Facebook as Custom Audiences by themselves.
The Custom Audiences certification tool could close that loophole. It’s still being built, so Facebook wouldn’t say exactly how it will work. I asked if Facebook would scan uploaded user lists and try to match them against a database of suspicious data, but for now it sounds more like Facebook will merely require a written promise.
Meanwhile, barring the sharing of Custom Audiences between Business Accounts might prevent those with access to email lists from using them to promote companies unrelated to the one to which users gave their email address. Facebook declined to comment on how the new ban on Custom Audience sharing would work.
Now Facebook must find ways to thwart misuse of its targeting tools and audit anyone it suspects may have already violated its policies. Otherwise it may receive the ire of privacy-conscious users and critics, and strengthen the case for substantial regulation of its ads (though regulation could end up protecting Facebook from competitors who can’t afford compliance). Still the question remains why it took such a massive data privacy scandal for Facebook to take a tougher stance on requiring user consent for ad targeting. And given that written promises didn’t stop Kogan or Cambridge Analytica from misusing data, why would they stop advertisers bent on boosting profits?

14,"At a time when the models of traditional social networks are being questioned, it’s more important than ever to experiment with alternatives. Arbtr is a proposed social network that limits users to sharing a single thing at any given time, encouraging “ruthless self-editing” and avoiding “nasty things” like endless feeds filled with trivial garbage.
It’s seeking funds on Kickstarter and could use a buck or two. I plan to.
Now, I know what you’re thinking. “Why would I give money to maybe join a social network eventually that might not have any of my friends on it on it? That is, if it ever even exists?” Great question.
The answer is: how else do you think we’re going to replace Facebook? Someone with a smart, different idea has to come along and we have to support them. If we won’t spare the cost of a cup of coffee for a purpose like that, then we deserve the social networks we’ve got. (And if I’m honest, I’ve had very similar ideas over the last few years and I’m eager to see how they might play out in reality.)
The fundamental feature is, of course, the single-sharing thing. You can only show off one item at a time, and when you post a new one, the old one (and any discussion, likes, etc) will be deleted. There will be options to keep logs of these things, and maybe premium features to access them (or perhaps metrics), but the basic proposal is, I think, quite sound — at the very least, worth trying.
Some design ideas for the app. I like the text one but it does need thumbnails.
If you’re sharing less, as Arbtr insists you will, then presumably you’ll put more love behind those things you do share. Wouldn’t that be nice?
We’re in this mess because we bought wholesale the idea that the more you share, the more connected you are. Now that we’ve found that isn’t the case – and in fact we were in effect being fattened for a perpetual slaughter — I don’t see why we shouldn’t try something else.
Will it be Arbtr? I don’t know. Probably not, but we’ve got a lot to gain by giving ideas like this a shot.","At a time when the models of traditional social networks are being questioned, it's more important than ever to experiment with alternatives.

It was barely minutes after the Ready Player One premiere, and texts from my friends and colleagues in the VR community began pouring in…
“How was it?”
Those of us in the mixed reality industries have been waiting for this film like the VR messiah that will deliver us to public mass adoption. And the breathless prayer? “Please, oh please, let Ready Player One make VR look cool.”
To many, VR creators make expensive content that few will ever experience or have interest in experiencing. I have read dozens of articles in the last year announcing either the end or the beginning of VR. 
I have seen VR portrayed as a portent for humanity’s most solitary, basic, and evil instincts over and over again in television and film. Most of all, I received questions from people that are confused by what this technology is and moreover, why it even has value. 
Because of Ready Player One, there are now giant billboards on streets around the world where someone is wearing a VR Headset. For those of us who have lived and breathed this technology for years, this movie is everything. 
And so, I was excited to find that yes, this movie portrays something that I’ve known and felt in my bones for a while now — VR is in fact cool.
I’m imagining that people will now want to suit up, run to THE VOID or the Imax Experience Center and try VR for themselves. But here’s a word of caution to the uninitiated: VR is currently not the OASIS. Please do not expect VR to feel, look and behave like the OASIS, because we are not there yet. But I’ll be damned if we’re not close. 
So given this, here’s an overview of what’s present in the film, where we are today, and what the future might hold.
NOTE: Some minor film spoilers below.

Headsets 
Film:
At first glance, the headsets in Ready Player One look surprisingly like generation one Oculus Rifts in size and shape. However, the film claims that Head-Mounted Displays (HMDs) projection in 2024 is composed of harmless lasers beaming directly into your retinas– far from our current display-based HMDs. The film’s headsets appear to be inside-out tracking, lightweight, wireless, and can produce images indistinguishable from reality with minimal or no processing lag. Other sci-fi-based headsets appear later in the film, when Wade upgrades his HMD to a model with semi-transparent glass. In the book, there are allusions to OASIS’ massive servers in Columbus, so all the processing power is probably not coming from the headsets themselves but rather sent via 5G (or higher) network to each user.
Today: 
Off-the-shelf HMDs are tethered to powerful PCs, and those coming later in 2018 (Vive Pro , Oculus Go, and supposedly Oculus Prototype Santa Cruz, among others) are either a mobile-based power/resolution or require a PC wireless display link. While we don’t have lasers entering our retinas (yet), we can assume someone’s working on it.
Tomorrow: 
When it is released, Magic Leap promises to be the closest thing we have to a complex mixed reality headset. It beams information directly into your eyes that utilize your sense of depth, which should make for a more comfortable experience than hours in a headset staring at pixels; yet, it’s imperfect as the field of view will in no way be full resolution like in the OASIS. Right now the design is somewhat clunky– there’s still a walkman-like battery pack to deal with and a FOV of 40 degrees at best. Other than the release of Ready Player One, the launch of Magic Leap One is probably the most anticipated event in the brief history of VR. As a side note, the term “VR” may no longer be applicable, because it’s predicted that AR and VR headsets will merge and become one device.

Haptics
Film: 
The haptic suits in RPO are aesthetically gorgeous. As described in the original book, an interwebbing of sensors and material covers the user’s body — it looks like a slim-fit wetsuit but with gloves and boots. When characters get shot or hit in VR, they feel the pain on their bodies, which thematically ups the stakes during the battle scenes. There’re also a few instances of “pleasure” haptics. 
In the VR nightclub, Art3mis dances against Wade and the crotch region of his suit, ahem, “activates.” Other scenes contain a few cheeky allusions to some risque things people might be be up to in the OASIS.
Our villain Nolan Sorrento wears a haptic suit on his bouts in the OASIS, but usually confines the haptic experience to an ornate leather chair that allows him to feel sensations/maintain a patriarchal technical overlord vibe. (Cool.)
Today: 
Sorrento’s chair feels reminiscent of the Positron rig that has been dotting film festivals and hotels lately. They’re quite comfy and are great for first time VR users. In terms of romantic haptics, the teledildonics and VR porn industry is alive and well, and new products keep being developed. Haptic gloves like Haptx VR Gloves do exist and keep getting better! So far, texture, shape, and cold/warm sensations are all achievable by individual systems and products.
Tomorrow: 
Complete sensory VR immersion is years away, but is one of the most oft requested and dreamed about advances in the industry. Teslasuit appears to be the next product to market that aims to let you feel it all in VR, and it looks a hell of a lot like Wade’s suit. 

Movement
Film:
One of the first scenes in the film features Wade navigating the OASIS on a simple omnidirectional treadmill. As the film progresses, movement mechanics get into completely new territory. The “sixers” (the film’s enemy army against the Gunters) stand upright in individual pods with treadmills beneath them; if needed, they and can sit down to “drive” vehicles. On the Gunter side, in Aech’s truck the “Hive Five” are tethered to the ceiling via cables for unobstructed fighting moves. 
Today:
Omnidirectional treadmills exist today but the kinks are being ironed out. Many are designed similar to ones in the film (micro- and macro-treadmill arrangements). User motion tracking is done via external sensors, and for maximum movement the closest thing we have to a tetherless VR experience is location-based experiences a la The Void, and that still requires backpacks. 
Tomorrow: 
A Virtual Reality where your physical movements match virtually in a 1:1 ratio without the need for wires. Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) are already in use for motion capture in films and games, and these systems can be integrated into next-next-gen haptic suits for full-body presence. (That being considered, some folks will always want to play from a couch or chair.)

Digital currency
Film: 
One universal currency exists in the OASIS, and its value is more stable than real-world currency. (Is FIAT even real currency some might ask? Don’t start with me, man). In the OASIS, currency is more trusted than in the actual world. Wade receives bonuses for leveling up in the race to catch the egg, and uses digital currency to order real products via drones in the real world. In the OASIS, users can go on quests that require work that are actual proof-of work. 
Today: 
So cryptocurrency today is a bit of a mess. Between ICO’s failing to launch or completely made up advisory boards, people are doubting the security of a digital currency. That being said, millions of people are eager to learn more about this currency revolution and its claims to strive for the financial equalization of the world. 
Tomorrow: 
Democratizing cryptocurrency is paramount. Some companies, like Robin Hood, are doing a great job by providing cryptocurrency to the masses via readily accessible mobile apps. Some argue that Ready Player One actually predicted the rise of cryptocurrency; however, it did not predict alt-coins such as Ethereum, Monero or Ripple.

Avatars
Film: 
As Wade declares in the beginning of the film, in the OASIS you can “be whomever you want to be”, whatever appearance, ethnicity, background, gender, sex, or species. It’s all up to you as a consumer and denizen of the OASIS. For example, Wade dawns a haircut which is then corrected by Art3mis to be cooler (more spikey). Wade’s best friend Aech is an African American female but is able to be a male muscled warlord in the OASIS. There’s a glorious beauty to avatars in this film for the free folk that is contrasted by the monochromatic Sixers in their Loyalty Centers. This is a free and open internet — be who you want to be. 
Today: 
It would be lovely if who we are in VR is a direct representation of our real selves — however current methods for duplication leave out facets of what makes us human. For example, Facebook wouldn’t let this VR user be fat. Scanning technologies such as Windows Mixed Reality capture stages can scan your likeness — but it will cost a pretty penny.
Tomorrow: 
In the future, avatar creation will be a democratized process where users can scan themselves (either face or body) to import into the cloud, or simply be whatever figure suits their preference. Think of this as a VR Chat-level of character selection but with customization to the nines. 

We are at the cusp of a media revolution: New definitions of reality develop every day, and Ready Player One is giving these technologies mass market exposure. 
At the same time, this film speaks to the morality surrounding how we equip ourselves with immersive tech in the new digital frontier. Will the OASIS be well protected and well propagated? Should we look to artists or business people to be the curators of this space?
If we are to avoid the advertisement-laden virtual realm that RPO’s 101 Industries desires, we must take steps in this early adoption phase. That is the core of the film’s premise: virtual reality has as much impact on the world as real reality. Choose wisely.

16,"At last, a use for that industrial knitting machine you bought at a yard sale! Carnegie Mellon researchers have created a method that generates knitting patterns for arbitrary 3D shapes, opening the possibility of “on-demand knitting.” Think 3D printing, but softer.
The idea is actually quite compelling for those of us who are picky about their knitwear. How often have we picked up a knit cap, glove, or scarf only to find it too long, too short, too tight, too loose, etc?
If you fed your sartorial requirements (a 3D mesh) into this system from James McCann and students at CMU’s Textiles Lab, it could quickly spit out a pattern that a knitting machine could follow easily yet is perfectly suited for your purposes.
This has to be done carefully — the machines aren’t the same as human knitters, obviously, and a poorly configured pattern might lead to yarn breaking or jamming the machine. But it’s a lot better than having to build that pattern purl by purl.
With a little more work, “Knitting machines could become as easy to use as 3D printers,” McCann said in a CMU news release.
Of course, it’s unlikely you’ll have one of your own. But maker spaces and designer ateliers (I believe that’s the term) will be more likely to if it’s this easy to create new and perfectly sized garments with them.
McCann and his team will be presenting their research at SIGGRAPH this summer.","At last, a use for that industrial knitting machine you bought at a yard sale!

17,"When Facebook  loses, who wins?
That’s a question for startups that may be worth contemplating following Facebook’s recent stock price haircut. The company’s valuation has fallen by around $60 billion since the Cambridge Analytica scandal surfaced earlier this month and the #DeleteFacebook campaign gained momentum.
That’s a steep drop, equal to about 12 percent of the company’s market valuation, and it’s a decline Facebook appears to be suffering alone. As its shares fell over the past couple of weeks, stocks of other large-cap tech and online media companies have been much flatter.
So where did the money go? It’s probably a matter of perspective. For a Facebook shareholder, that valuation is simply gone. And until executives’ apologies resonate and users’ desire to click and scroll overcomes their privacy fears, that’s how it is.
An alternate view is that the valuation didn’t exactly disappear. Investors may still believe the broad social media space is just as valuable as it was a couple of weeks ago. It’s just that less of that pie should be the exclusive domain of Facebook.
If one takes that second notion, then the possibilities for who could benefit from Facebook’s travails start to get interesting. Of course, there are public market companies, like Snap or Twitter, that might pick up traffic if the #DeleteFacebook movement gains momentum without spreading to other big brands. But it’s in the private markets where we see the highest number of potential beneficiaries of Facebook’s problems.
In an effort to come up with some names, we searched through Crunchbase for companies in social media and related areas. The resulting list includes companies that have raised good-sized rounds in the past couple of years and could conceivably see gains if people cut back on using Facebook or owning its stock.
Of course, people use Facebook for different things (posting photos, getting news, chatting with friends and so on), so we lay out a few categories of potential beneficiaries of a Facebook backlash.
Messaging
Facebook has a significant messaging presence, but it hasn’t been declared the winner. Alternatives like Snap, LINE, WeChat and plain old text messages are also massively popular.
That said, what’s bad for Messenger and Facebook-owned WhatsApp is probably good for competitors. And if more people want to do less of their messaging on Facebook, it helps that there are a number of private companies ready to take its place.
Crunchbase identified six well-funded messaging apps that could fit the bill (see list). Collectively, they’ve raised well over $2 billion — if one includes the $850 million initial coin offering by Telegram.
Increasingly, these private messaging startups are focused on privacy and security, including Wickr, the encrypted messaging tool that has raised more than $70 million, and Silent Circle, another encrypted communications provider that has raised $130 million.
Popular places to browse on a screen
People who cut back on Facebook may still want to spend hours a day staring at posts on a screen. So it’s likely they’ll start staring at something else that’s content-rich, easy-to-navigate and somewhat addictive.
Luckily, there are plenty of venture-backed companies that fit that description. Many of these are quite mature at this point, including Pinterest for image collections, Reddit for post and comment threads and Quora for Q&A (see list).
Granted, these will not replace the posts keeping you up to date on the life events of family and friends. But they could be a substitute for news feeds, meme shares and other non-personal posts.
Niche content
A decline in Facebook usage could translate into a rise in traffic for a host of niche content and discussion platforms focused on sports, celebrities, social issues and other subjects.
Crunchbase News identified at least a half-dozen that have raised funding in recent quarters, which is just a sampling of the total universe. Selected startups run the gamut from The Players’ Tribune, which features first-hand accounts for top athletes, to Medium, which seeks out articles that resonate with a wide audience.
Niche sites also provide a more customized forum for celebrities, pundits and subject-matter experts to engage directly with fans and followers.
Community and engagement
People with common interests don’t have to share them on Facebook. There are other places that can offer more tailored content and social engagement.
In recent years, we’ve seen an increase in community and activity-focused social apps gain traction. Perhaps the most prominent is Nextdoor, which connects neighbors for everything from garage sales to crime reports. We’re also seeing some upstarts focused on creating social networks for interest groups. These include Mighty Networks and Amino Apps.
Though some might call it a stretch, we also added to the list WeWork, recent acquirer of Meetup, and The Guild, two companies building social networks in the physical world. These companies are encouraging people to come out and socially network with other people (even if just means sitting in a room with other people staring at a screen).
Watch where the money goes
Facebook’s latest imbroglio is still too recent to expect a visible impact in the startup funding arena. But it will be interesting to watch in the coming months whether potential rivals in the above categories raise a lot more cash and attract more users.
If there’s demand, there’s certainly no shortage of supply on the investor front. The IPO window is wide open, and venture investors are sitting on record piles of dry powder. It hasn’t escaped notice, either, that social media offerings, like Facebook, LinkedIn and Snap, have generated the biggest exit total of any VC-funded sector.
Moreover, those who’ve argued that it’s too late for newcomers have a history of being proven wrong. After all, that’s what people were saying about would-be competitors to MySpace in 2005, not long before Facebook made it big.","When Facebook loses, who wins?

18,"The Red Hat Linux distribution is turning 25 years old this week. What started as one of the earliest Linux distributions is now the most successful open-source company, and its success was a catalyst for others to follow its model. Today’s open-source world is very different from those heady days in the mid-1990s when Linux looked to be challenging Microsoft’s dominance on the desktop, but Red Hat is still going strong.
To put all of this into perspective, I sat down with the company’s current CEO (and former Delta Air Lines COO) Jim Whitehurst to talk about the past, present and future of the company, and open-source software in general. Whitehurst took the Red Hat  CEO position 10 years ago, so while he wasn’t there in the earliest days, he definitely witnessed the evolution of open source in the enterprise, which is now more widespread than every.
“Ten years ago, open source at the time was really focused on offering viable alternatives to traditional software,” he told me. “We were selling layers of technology to replace existing technology. […] At the time, it was open source showing that we can build open-source tech at lower cost. The value proposition was that it was cheaper.”
At the time, he argues, the market was about replacing Windows with Linux or IBM’s WebSphere with JBoss. And that defined Red Hat’s role in the ecosystem, too, which was less about technological information than about packaging. “For Red Hat, we started off taking these open-source projects and making them usable for traditional enterprises,” said Whitehurst.

About five or six ago, something changed, though. Large corporations, including Google and Facebook, started open sourcing their own projects because they didn’t look at some of the infrastructure technologies they opened up as competitive advantages. Instead, having them out in the open allowed them to profit from the ecosystems that formed around that. “The biggest part is it’s not just Google and Facebook finding religion,” said Whitehurst. “The social tech around open source made it easy to make projects happen. Companies got credit for that.”
He also noted that developers now look at their open-source contributions as part of their resumé. With an increasingly mobile workforce that regularly moves between jobs, companies that want to compete for talent are almost forced to open source at least some of the technologies that don’t give them a competitive advantage.
As the open-source ecosystem evolved, so did Red Hat. As enterprises started to understand the value of open source (and stopped being afraid of it), Red Hat shifted from simply talking to potential customers about savings to how open source can help them drive innovation. “We’ve gone from being commeditizers to being innovators. The tech we are driving is now driving net new innovation,” explained Whitehurst. “We are now not going in to talk about saving money but to help drive innovation inside a company.”
Over the last few years, that included making acquisitions to help drive this innovation. In 2015, Red Hat bought IT automation service Ansible, for example, and last month, the company closed its acquisition of CoreOS, one of the larger independent players in the Kubernetes container ecosystem — all while staying true to its open-source root.
There is only so much innovation you can do around a Linux distribution, though, and as a public company, Red Hat also had to look beyond that core business and build on it to better serve its customers. In part, that’s what drove the company to launch services like OpenShift, for example, a container platform that sits on top of Red Hat Enterprise Linux and — not unlike the original Linux distribution — integrates technologies like Docker and Kubernetes and makes them more easily usable inside an enterprise.

The reason for that? “I believe that containers will be the primary way that applications will be built, deployed and managed,” he told me, and argued that his company, especially after the CoreOS acquisition, is now a leader in both containers and Kubernetes. “When you think about the importance of containers to the future of IT, it’s a clear value for us and for our customers.”
The other major open-source project Red Hat is betting on is OpenStack . That may come as a bit of a surprise, given that popular opinion in the last year or so has shifted against the massive project that wants to give enterprises an open source on-premise alternative to AWS and other cloud providers. “There was a sense among big enterprise tech companies that OpenStack was going to be their savior from Amazon,” Whitehurst said. “But even OpenStack, flawlessly executed, put you where Amazon was five years ago. If you’re Cisco or HP or any of those big OEMs, you’ll say that OpenStack was a disappointment. But from our view as a software company, we are seeing good traction.”
Because OpenStack is especially popular among telcos, Whitehurst believes it will play a major role in the shift to 5G. “When we are talking to telcos, […] we are very confident that OpenStack will be the platform for 5G rollouts.”
With OpenShift and OpenStack, Red Hat believes that it has covered both the future of application development and the infrastructure on which those applications will run. Looking a bit further ahead, though, Whitehurst also noted that the company is starting to look at how it can use artificial intelligence and machine learning to make its own products smarter and more secure, but also at how it can use its technologies to enable edge computing. “Now that large enterprises are also contributing to open source, we have a virtually unlimited amount of material to bring our knowledge to,” he said.

19,"At some point in the not-so-distant past, April Fools was about pranks and hoaxes, but given that we apparently have enough of those on the web, the day has somehow morphed into a celebration of random jokey things. This year’s Google  Maps gag is no exception.
Starting today, when you open Google Maps on your phone or desktop, you’ll see Waldo in his trademark red and white sweater, waving at you you from the side of your screen. That’s because Waldo  is sharing his location with you for the next few days and he really wants to be found (or not… I’m never quite sure about what Waldo’s real motivations are…). You can also ask the Google Assistant “Hey Google. Where’s Waldo?”
Then, when you click on Waldo in the map, you get to see a standard “Where is Waldo” image and your job is to find him, as well as Woof, Wenda, Wizard Whitebeard and Odlaw.
Now if Google had wanted to make this a real April Fools joke, it would’ve announced this and then never released it or just shown you a standard “Where is Waldo” image without Waldo. That way, it would’ve driven everybody mad. But I’m pretty sure it’s for real, so head over to Google Maps and give it a try.

Here’s a wrap of the day’s news.
Blockchain and cryptocurrencies
Chinese central bank to tighten regulation on cryptocurrencies (China). The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) will launch a clampdown on all types of digital currencies, said one of its vice governors in a statement released yesterday. The PBOC started researching and developing its own virtual currency in November last year, and will up the ante this year, the statement added. Earlier this year, government banned crypto-trading and initial coin offerings nationwide. (Reuters)
Telecommunication
China Telecom eyes Philippine telco market (Philippines). The state-owned carrier is confident that the Philippines welcomes interest in its telecommunications sector from China and other foreign investors, said company CEO and chairman Yang Jie, even as the two countries are embroiled in a decades-long maritime dispute. HIs statement comes as President Rodrigo Duterte plans to grant another license and introduce competition in a market dominated by the duopoly of Globe Telecom, a unit of Singapore’s Telecommunications , and PLDT, which is backed by Indonesia’s Salim Group and Japan’s NTT. Yang added that while the official application process hasn’t started, the firm is working on “further understanding and communicating” about the deal. (Nikkei Asian Review)
Ecommerce
Online fashion platform closes series C round led by Google (India). Mumbai-headquartered Fynd said it has raised an undisclosed amount of funding in its series C round, which was led by Google, and plans use the money to improve its engagements with retailers and consumers alike. The startup lets physical retail stores list their entire selections on its platform and provides them access to its online ecommerce marketplace. (DealStreetAsia)
Policy and regulation
Central bank thwarts attempted cyberattack (Malaysia). An attempt by hackers using fraudulent wire transfers to siphon money was discovered and prevented on Tuesday, Bank Negara Malaysia said in a statement. Bank Negara clarified that no funds were lost in the incident – the second known cyberattack on a central bank. The first such hack happened in 2016, when US$81 million was stolen from Bangladesh Bank. (Reuters)
Media and entertainment
Baidu spinoff iQiyi makes shaky debut on NASDAQ (China). The video-on-demand service debuted on US stock exchange on Thursday at an opening price of US$18.20, but gains skidded down to US$15.55 at closing – well below its IPO price. CEO Gong Yu dismissed any concerns, describing the fluctuations as “short-term volatility.”  (Reuters)
Startup and ecosystems
AI platform targets gender bias in male-dominated tech industry (Singapore). Three high school students in the city-state have built Hequals, an app that auto-assigns tasks based on skills and work history, making it immune to gender or other discriminatory biases. It was inspired in part by a co-founder’s sister, who interned at Amazon. The team was also motivated by a 2016 report in The Guardian report about bias against female software developers and their work. (E27)
Transportation
Grab-Uber mega deal faces scrutiny from competition regulators (Singapore, Philippines). The Competition Commission of Singapore (CCS) is investigating whether ride-hailing app Grab’s purchase of rival Uber’s Southeast Asian business has breached the country’s Competition Act. This is the first time that CCS has issued such a notice following a merger. Elsewhere in the region, the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) is also probing whether the deal is anti-competitive. Grab said it plans to meet with the PCC to address their concerns. (Tech in Asia)

The Competition Commission of Singapore (CCS) suspects that Southeast Asia’s leading ride-hailing app Grab has infringed the country’s Competition Act by purchasing rival Uber’s Southeast Asian operations, it said in a statement.
The CCS began investigating the deal on March 27, and the outcome is yet to be determined. In the interim, it is proposing that both parties maintain their pre-transaction pricing, pricing policies, and product options.  This is the first time that the Singapore body has issued such a notice following a merger.
The directive requests both parties to refrain from obtaining “any confidential information, including but not limited to information pertaining to pricing, formulas, customers, and drivers” from each other.
Finally, the proposal asks Grab to ensure that “Uber drivers joining its Grab’s ride-hailing platform of their own accord are not subject to any exclusivity clauses, lock-in periods and/or termination fees.”
The CCS will accept written submissions from both parties before deciding whether to implement the proposal. If issued, the directive will take effect immediately and last until the investigation is completed.
In response to the statement from CCS, Grab has “voluntarily committed to maintaining our fare structure and will not increase base fares,” Lim Kell Jay, head of Grab Singapore, tells Tech in Asia.
A key consideration for the watchdog may be Grab’s classification. Is it a third-party taxi booking app or a taxi operator? If it’s the former, it would own a monopoly. If it’s the latter, it may be judged to be competitive with ComfortDelGro, which is Singapore’s largest taxi operator.
Legal precedent may play a role in the decision. Despite its protests, Uber was deemed a transport operator by the European court of justice. In a lot of ways, Grab is similar to a taxi operator in Singapore: It owns a car rental service which supplies vehicles to Grab drivers.
Another consideration for CCS may be the future competitive landscape. Singapore has seven taxi operators, though the smaller ones partner with Grab to accept bookings through its app. Local app Ryde will launch a car-hailing service, but it has only raised US$1.5 million dollars from investors compared to Grab’s billions. Indonesia’s Go-Jek plans to announce an expansion to three Southeast Asian countries, but no other details have been revealed yet.
Concern from all quarters
Since the merger announcement, consumers worry that prices for Grab’s rides may rise. Some have also raised data privacy concerns after Uber sent a notice to its users that their data will be automatically transferred to Grab.
“I personally think Uber should be asking customers if they are OK with the data transfer or not. As I know they are not automatically porting my account over, so why should my Uber data be sent to Grab without my consent?” asked Michael Smith Jr., a partner at venture capital firm SeedPlus, on e27.
Lawyer Choo Zheng Xi believes Uber and Grab may have breached Singapore’s Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) “by purporting to transfer Uber user data to Grab without users’ express consent.” Choo is a litigation lawyer and director at Singapore-based law firm Peter Low & Choo.
Uber sent this to users after the Grab deal.
It’s not just consumers and the authorities in Singapore that are concerned. In Manila, the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) has said that it is looking closely at the deal to determine if it is anti-competitive.
“We have to establish an analysis that the transaction could lead to a lessening of competition. If that’s the case and we tell the parties that information and if they don’t address concerns to our satisfaction, we will disallow the transaction,” PCC chairman Arsenio Balisacan told ABS-CBN News.

Illuminated by fluorescent lights and geometric decor, the esports center looks modeled after the science fiction franchise Tron. Clusters of professional gamers sit around circular tables clicking furiously. At the back, an enormous screen shows a live stream of King Pro League, Tencent’s tournament for its mobile game Honor of Kings.
Welcome to the next generation of internet cafes in China. Called esports centers, these venues are better equipped, more professional, and enthusiastically supported – surprisingly – by the Chinese government. Despite their wariness towards game addiction, Chinese officials are warming up to esports.
“The government isn’t stupid – they might criticize [gaming], but the industry’s track record speaks for itself,” says Ren Li, president and CEO of Pengta Network Technology, a Shanghai-based startup that runs Amazing Center, a chain of esports centers in China.
Ren’s business has been able to expand quickly thanks to interest from local governments, some of which are creating their own “esports towns“, complete with esports stadiums and incubators for gaming startups. In exchange for esports expertise, officials are willing to provide the real estate, explains Ren.
“One center used to cost [US$1.6 million] to open – now it costs half that,” he says. “In some cases, the government pays us to open a center.”

It’s not difficult to see why. China is the largest gaming market in the world, with a thriving esports scene that brought over US$100 million in revenue last year, according to market research firm Newzoo. At the same time, the industry is still nascent and lacks infrastructure when it comes to events, community building, training, and fan engagement. Like the movement offline in “new retail” and ecommerce, brick-and-mortar hubs like Amazing Center could have a symbiotic relationship with the esports industry, helping it grow and become more professional.
China’s internet cafes, for instance, have benefited enormously from competitive gaming. According to a 2016 report by Asian games-market researcher Niko Partners, China had 146,000 internet cafes with 20 million daily users in 2015. Both numbers are increasing year-on-year, as internet cafes have turned into social spaces for gamers and esports fans.

“Internet cafes have become an important part of the esports ecosystem in China to promote esports to a larger audience. In return, the local events help increase the exposure of these cafes,” explains Tianyi Gu, China market analyst at Newzoo. Esports centers are seen as an upgraded version of internet cafes, which attract more professional players and hold higher-level tournaments, she says.
“The entry barrier to become an esports player in China is, overall, lower than other countries,” Gu adds.

Esports centers hint at the wider ecosystem growing around esports. Some have livestreaming booths complete with green screens, catering to the growing professionalism of streamers – an effort that has seen multi-million dollar investments from gaming companies, such as NetEase, Tencent’s domestic archrival.
Unlike internet cafes, which offer high-end computers to consumers on a pay-per-hour basis, esports centers can also serve businesses interested in the competitive gaming space, especially those that see esports as a way to appeal to young consumers. China Eastern Airlines and Shanghai Metro, for instance, have both outsourced gaming competitions and events to Amazing Center.
You don’t have to worry about crazy fans.
Esports hubs are also eyeing the entertainment side of gaming, which includes variety shows and TV series about esports and gaming celebrities. Some are even offering training programs to cultivate esports commentators, livestreamers, and gaming celebrities. This year, an esports show starring the Killer Angels, an all-women’s league in Shanghai, will be filmed at Amazing Center.
“If I was traveling outside of Shanghai and had to choose between [training in] an esports center and an internet cafe, I would definitely choose an esports center,” says Zhou Jie, an ex-esports player and manager of the Killer Angels. “There’s more privacy. You don’t have to worry about crazy fans.”
The Killer Angels train out of Amazing Center, which also hosts traveling esports teams and domestic stars like LGD, a well-known Chinese group that competes in Defense of the Ancients 2 tournaments. If LGD was at an internet cafe, the entrance would be packed with fans, says Zhou. “The door would practically come down – there would be people everywhere.”

The launch of esports hubs also rides on the efforts of large gaming companies, such as Tencent and NetEase, both of which are pushing their own leagues and local competitions. Esports center VSPN, for example, helps Tencent operate and run its King Pro League tournaments in Shanghai and Chengdu. According to Chinese media, the 2017 spring season of King Pro League saw 15 million daily viewers.
This year, VSPN will also organize competitions for CrossFire, a first-person shooter game released in China by Tencent.
“Offline esports events – viewed live, in person, in an [internet cafe] or at a stadium – bring high energy, proximity of fans and players, and greater fan engagement,” says Lisa Hanson, managing director of Niko Partners. “Tencent and Alibaba are prioritizing the promotion of esports held in [internet cafes], universities, cities, and other locations to keep up the excitement level.”
Growing professionalism
To be sure, the esports center model is still in development. Some facilities are open to consumers and everyday gamers, while others rely on event revenue to get by. Other venues, such as Amazing Center, also offer esports training courses, which teach students, fresh graduates, and gamers how to organize and run gaming events, from lighting to setting up the stage.
“To be honest, everyone is still trying to figure out [the business model],” observes Zhou. “Most are doing internet cafes because they don’t know how to profit from an esports center – which requires a lot more investment than an internet cafe.”
To be honest, everyone is still trying to figure out the business model.
And while major cities such as Shanghai and Chengdu have organized several large-scale esports tournaments, it remains to be seen whether smaller locales can draw enough attention via competitive gaming – or if government-funded spaces will sit empty. Last year, Zhongxian, a small city in southwest China, announced plans to construct a US$220 million online gaming complex, after scrapping construction plans to reinvent itself as an “eco city.”
However, other opportunities are emerging in the esports industry, some of which could be paired with the offline esports model. Finding the right esports coach or trainer is still difficult, as the pool of experienced and renowned ex-esports players is much smaller than traditional sports. The industry also lacks standards – some new teams assume that any ex-player from a successful or well-known esports team qualifies as a good coach, contends Zhou.
“The need for esports coaching in the classic sense of player motivation and development is high. It’s going to be a field that develops very fast,” notes Johnathan Wendel, chief gaming officer of esports team management platform ReadyUp. Also known as Fatal1ty, Wendel is one of the first esports players to become a full-time professional.
“Coaching can save players and teams tens if not hundreds of hours, so skilled coaches are going to become very valuable,” he says.

When Singapore’s Supreme Court handed down its judgment in the breach of contract and copyright infringement dispute between rival online property sites PropertyGuru and 99.co earlier this month, both sides claimed victory.
PropertyGuru co-founder and executive director Jani Rautiainen said in a statement that his company was “very happy with the decision that is in our favor.” 
99.co founder and CEO Darius Cheung said “we have won” and that the ruling was “a victory for the Internet, the challengers, and most importantly, the content creators.”
According to Cheung, this wasn’t just a spat between two competitors – it was an attack on online businesses that rely on third-party content, and user-generated content (UGC) in particular.
See: 99.co and PropertyGuru each claim victory in copyright and contract dispute
So who really won? And what does the decision mean for the myriad businesses that lean on UGC?
Copyright and user-generated content
While PropertyGuru can claim at least partial victory with regards to 99.co’s breach of part of a 2015 settlement agreement between the two, the court dismissed its copyright infringement claims.
“In summary, the copying, enlargement, or resizing of an artistic work, such as a drawing, painting, or photograph, does not make the resulting image a copyrighted work,” Hoo Sheau Peng, the judge presiding over the case, wrote in her decision.
She also ruled that the addition of a watermark to a photo – something that PropertyGuru had done to those posted on its site by agents – does not “make the altered image an original work,” and therefore eligible for copyright protection in its own right. 
The judgment does not detract from long-established copyright principles, says Mark Teng, an advocate and solicitor specializing in intellectual property law at Infinitus Law in Singapore.
“It is clear that the ownership of copyright in such original works belonged to the users who took the photographs and not PropertyGuru,” he adds. 
PropertyGuru co-founder and executive director Jani Rautiainen / Photo credit: PropertyGuru
PropertyGuru asserted that by adding its own watermarks and “resizing, tweaking the light balance, and softening the edges” the photos became “substantially different” from the originals. 
PropertyGuru’s copyright claim, therefore, hinged on whether a new artistic work was created by way of such alterations to UGC, Teng says. He adds that the judge rightly observed that PropertyGuru’s skill and labor was not “deployed towards making a difference to the artistic nature of the photograph” and found that the resultant watermarked image was not a “materially different image from the original photograph as to render it a copyrightable work in itself.”
99.co believes “that the rights of the content belong to content creators,” Cheung wrote in his post-verdict statement.
“If you were to upload a photo to Facebook or Instagram or eBay, these sites do not and should not automatically get the rights on your photo simply by adding watermarks or basic modification,” he added. 
“Otherwise all hell breaks loose and the rights to the photos posted on the internet (inadvertently via a platform), would belong to the platform who claims them as their own and use them however they please. One would think it is common sense that this cannot be the case.”
Cheung further stated that, in his belief, “large corporations” have often tried to gain an advantage over smaller competitors by preventing the free use of content by the content owner. “In the end, monopolies prevailed and the ones who got hurt most were the content creators and consumers.”

The world hasn’t changed
While Cheung is positive on the outcome, Teng suggests the case doesn’t generally change the legal position of UGC.
“Typically, the terms and conditions of websites that host UGC do not transfer ownership of the intellectual property rights in that UGC to the website,” he says. 
Major platforms like Facebook, LinkedIn, and Instagram typically only obtain a non-exclusive worldwide license to use the intellectual property rights of the users. This is necessary so as to facilitate the communication of such content to other users, which is at the core of the business models practiced by such platforms, he adds.
“This case is no exception. A non-exclusive worldwide license was granted by users to PropertyGuru and this was one of the reasons why it could not rely on the copyright subsisting in the original images per se, and had to rely on the watermarked photographs for its copyright claim.” 
“This may have been a different case if the terms of service had effectively assigned the ownership of the copyright to the platform. This is an issue that users should take note of when agreeing to terms of service.”
Ownership and usage of UGC is an issue that stretches far beyond Singapore’s shores. Confusion abounds among users over Facebook’s rights to re-use photos, videos, and other content they post on their profiles, for example. 
Amid heightened concerns about exploitation of social media users’ data for potentially nefarious purposes, stricter regulation could be just around the corner. 
As for 99.co and PropertyGuru, the fight may not be over yet. The Supreme Court has already held a hearing regarding which side should be responsible for covering costs for the case. Singapore generally follows a “loser pays” system, so the yet-to-be-revealed outcome of the costs hearing could give us a stronger indication of which of the two could be said to have won the dispute.
Hoo also ruled that PropertyGuru is entitled to seek damages for 99.co’s partial breach of the settlement agreement through its “posting assistance service,” which helped agents to cross-post listings from the other site.
When asked if there had been any outcome from either the costs hearing or PropertyGuru’s potential pursuit of damages – or if either of the two parties planned to appeal the court’s decisions – Cheung told Tech in Asia that he could not comment at this stage. Meanwhile, a PropertyGuru spokesperson said that the company is reviewing the next steps with lawyers.

27,"

PropertyGuru is no stranger to Southeast Asia. Founded in 2007, the platform now has leadership presence in five countries – Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam, serving over 25 million property seekers monthly.
From startup to a regional leader, PropertyGuru believes that company culture is one of the key aspects which attributed to their success today. At a startup stage where change can happen quickly, flexibility in mindset and working styles are crucial. At the same time, PropertyGuru understands that in order to build efficient and scalable growth, processes need to be incorporated.
Why culture is key for growth companies
A research conducted by Glassdoor uncovered that across all income levels, the top predictor of workplace satisfaction is not pay; instead, it’s the organization’s culture and values. While it accounts for about 21.6 percent of workers’ satisfaction in the lowest income group (those earning under US$40,000 per year), it rises to 23.4 percent for the highest income group (those earning over US$120,000 per year) – suggesting that higher earners place more importance for their values to be aligned with that of a company’s.
Balancing between growth and culture is imperative. As a startup grows, change is inevitable, and it’s natural for a company to evolve. Challenges abound along with growth – for instance, financial concerns, and hiring the right people to bring a company to its next level. In addition, creating a clear company culture is often challenging for growing companies to figure out as they scale.
PropertyGuru is one such company that has managed to scale, and kept a strong culture at the same time.
Key aspects of culture at PropertyGuru Group
PropertyGuru follows a values-driven culture, where the way something is done is just as important as the result. Employees demonstrate their potential for growth through the flexibility and agility in their approach to their work and career. Several key cultures are put in place to ensure that PropertyGuru remains nimble even as they are in growth mode:
Experimentation
The company often encourages employees to conduct technology and sales or marketing experimentations in different markets. As they learn, they are able to invest in better processes to promptly bring those learnings to the other parts of the business.
Encourage feedback
Within PropertyGuru, multiple forums are available to share the company’s plans and visions. Employees are also able to give feedback through anonymous channels, so that the management team is able to understand its successes, as well as areas for improvement. Through the feedback channel, the company rolled out a benefits plan for flexible working hours – a request from some of its staff.
Access to leadership
With staff across five countries, it can be challenging to maintain a two-way communication between the management and employees. Hence, PropertyGuru’s leadership team works hard to make itself accessible and encourages people to reach out. Different discussion forums were created to facilitate a bi-directional relationship and to make it easier for employees to have access to the management.

You’re a budding entrepreneur with an affinity for technology who’s spotted a problem in the Indonesian financial market. You’re convinced that you might just have the solution for it, and you think that you’ve got what it takes to break into the fintech scene.
And who could blame you for wanting to? With over US$56 million dollars raised in funding and 46 recorded deals across Indonesia’s fintech industry, the ecommerce market alone is projected to be worth US$130 billion by 2020.
But with obstacles such as regulatory issues and low public awareness, building a fintech product is harder than it might seem, especially when compared to verticals like ecommerce. To help you find the best approach, Tech In Asia spoke with four startup founders about their experiences in the market, sharing how they got their slice of Indonesia’s fintech pie.
1. Start with a solid infrastructure (Cashlez)
When Cashlez set up shop in Indonesia in 2015, it was a new player in an old game.
“We were really just nobody starting out, and we had to convince big banks of what we were doing,” says Cashlez CEO Teddy Tee, who came upon the idea for a point-of-sales system that’s more localized than the electronic draft capture (EDC) terminal. These devices can be a hassle to install and maintain. Vendors also have to teach merchants how to use them.

“We definitely were not the first in the industry, but there was no existing capacity that catered to the Indonesian market,” he adds.
Cashlez persuaded corporates and banks to partner with them by having the right business model from the get-go. The startup was able to develop this thanks to Tee, who was the director for merchant sales and solutions at Visa Worldwide Indonesia from 2012 to 2015.
As he explains, “I knew how to convince corporates that we had proof of concept based on existing strategies and frameworks, but we wanted to make it Indonesian-focused.”
But for those who don’t have Tee’s banking experience, finding suitable advisors is key. Choose people “who know the ecosystem, the existing regulations, and have all the right networks to help you,” he recommends.
2. Gain the public’s trust (Modalku)
When peer-to-peer lending site Modalku was launched as a loan marketplace for small and medium-sized businesses in 2016, its founders had to pay the staff out of their own pockets.
“We started with dreams and nothing else,” recalls CEO Reynold Wijaya, who was undertaking a Master of Business Administration at Harvard Business School with co-founder Kelvin Teo when they set up shop. “It was crazy in the beginning.”
Like most entrepreneurs, Wijaya and his partners faced a host of challenges as they got the startup going. But when asked what he thinks is crucial in breaking into the scene, he says it was vital to gain the trust of the public, which didn’t know much about fintech.
As he points out, “Thankfully, although fintech was relatively unknown, Indonesia was welcoming of the new venture and less defensive to it than Singapore.” Wijaya speaks from experience: He established Funding Societies, a similar peer-to-peer loan marketplace localized to Singapore that also serves as Modalku’s parent company, in 2015.
“It was easier for us to launch in Indonesia, as we encountered people who were more open to new ideas. And we had a larger network to reach out to for funding and collaborations since we’re Indonesian,” he shares.
However, being welcomed by the public doesn’t necessarily ensure smooth sailing. According to Wijaya, Modalku has taken steps to be transparent by disclosing its portfolio performance – including information such as late and defaulted payments. It also sends out press releases frequently and holds webinars on any updates on the company.
“Without the trust of the public, how can you gain investments? We had to make an extra effort in being very engaging, not just to convince regulators of the benefits of our cause, but to show the public that we could be trusted,” says Wijaya.

3. Work with regulators (Investree)
The concept for Investree came about in 2015 when CEO Adrian Gunadi saw the potential of peer-to-peer lending as an alternative loan solution.
“There were opportunities in terms of a huge credit gap that was not being met by formal sectors, but also a huge pool of retail lenders that were untapped,” recounts Gunadi.
Prior to 2016, the term “fintech” barely saw any searches in Indonesia. But when Investree was rolled out, Gunadi immediately saw how the lack of existing regulations in the peer-to-peer lending sector could pose problems. “The market was there, demand was there, technology was there, but the lack of regulations made for a difficult launch,” he says.
He continues, “Dealing with money lending and investment space is a sensitive area. There was a risk that the central bank or regulators may deem our business illegal.”
As such, Investree immediately set out to find the most acceptable business model for the existing market, ensuring that it didn’t violate any regulations. It also started working with regulators in 2016 to define regulations for peer-to-peer lending.
“Once proof of concept was run, we conducted discussions with regulators and communicated our business model as a solution to a problem, and official regulations were issued by the end of the year,” shares Gunadi. “It made life much easier when talking to stakeholders or working with partners once we had legal standing.”
4. Stay ahead of your clientele (Faspay)
Faspay has been around since 2012. It helped the ecommerce market grow by providing an online payment gateway as an option at a time when peer-to-peer transfers and balance inquiries were the only ways people conducted transfers online.
According to Eddy Tju, Faspay’s vice president of business development, keeping up with their clients’ needs has enabled the startup to remain relevant in the market.
“We initially started working with Indonesia’s Bank Central Asia (BCA), but eventually merchants asked if they could conduct payments through other banks, so we formed partnerships with more banks,” says Tju.
Aside from providing discounts and educating the market on the uses and benefits of its online payment system, Faspay is trying to stay ahead of the curve by actively finding out how else they can assist merchants in Indonesia.
“We’re currently working on expanding to other payment options where we can see customers purchasing a product online and paying in cash at nearby convenience stores or retail outlets,” explains Tju. “This is especially useful to those who can’t afford a credit card or to students below the legal age who can’t pay in any way except cash.”
The ship hasn’t sailed yet to be part of Indonesia’s fintech scene / Image credit: Pexels
In 2016, Indonesia launched the National Strategy for Financial Inclusion (SNKI), which called for supportive regulations in a bid to help increase the proportion of the country’s citizens who have bank accounts.
In 2014, only 36 percent of Indonesians aged 15 and above had a bank account. The Indonesian government’s new target? 75 percent by 2019.
Indonesia still has a long way to go to reach its goal. Evidently, the desire for fintech that works for Indonesians is not a call to be ignored.
With growing government and investor support, Indonesia’s fintech scene is worth watching as it inevitably grows from promising innovation to invaluable service for digital businesses. So are you really going to sit back and watch, or will you be the next one on the startups-to-watch list?

Go-Jek set to announce Southeast Asia expansion (Indonesia). The Indonesian ride-hailing and online payment juggernaut may reveal its plans to launch in another Southeast Asian country “in the next few weeks,” according to a Reuters report. Backed by Google and China’s Tencent, the company is also looking to expand in three other countries in the region by mid-2018, the report said. The move will mark Go-Jek’s first foray outside its home market and tailgates Uber’s sale of its SEA business to rival Grab. (Reuters)

Fake-news bill introduced in parliament (Malaysia). This week, Malaysia tabled into parliament a bill that calls for heavy punishments for anyone found producing or circulating fake news in the country. Its official act is to safeguard the public against the spread of fake news while not infringing on the people’s constitutional rights to freedom of speech and expression. Critics like former prime minister Mahathir Mohamad called the bill vague and said that it serves a political agenda. Bills in Malaysia usually pass after two to three readings. The first was held on Monday. (The Star)

Central bank launches blockchain platform under its research institute (China). The People’s Bank of China-backed Zhongchao Blockchain Research Institute has applied for 22 blockchain patents. It has also introduced a blockchain registry open platform that dossiers information like user identities and provides verifiable information to businesses. This is the first Chinese central bank-supported blockchain platform in the country, though the nation has banned cryptocurrency trading and ICOs. (China Money Network)
Kakao to introduce its own blockchain platform (Korea). South Korea’s chat app said it will create its own open blockchain platform within the year. Rumors of an impending ICO have been reported, though the company has denied them. The firm said this platform will be combined with multiple services in the future, but at present it’s at the foundation stage. Earlier this month, Kakao formed a blockchain subsidiary called Ground X in Japan. (ZDNet)
Fintech
Fintech startup that targets SMEs raises US$1.7 million (Singapore). CardUp secured US$1.7 million in a seed round led by Sequoia India and early-stage VC fund Seedplus. The company lets users and businesses make large or recurring payments, traditionally done via bank transfers or checks, with their credit cards. These payments include rent, taxes, insurance, car loans, and payroll. (Tech in Asia)
Payment gateway considers sale at up to US$2 billion in valuation (India). BillDesk, backed by VC firms like Clearstone Venture and Singapore’s Temasek Holdings, has reportedly held talks to discuss a possible sale amid increased interest in payment market. The Indian startup was said to have met with three payment giants: PayU, American Express, and PayPal, all of which declined to meet its asking price of US$1.5 to 2 billion. BillDesk offers payment solutions for customers in sectors like ecommerce and retail. (DealStreetAsia)

Tech in Asia’s mission is to serve the region’s tech and startup community by connecting people through our events, bridging talent gaps via our Jobs platform, and offering insights into this exciting and evolving landscape through news, analysis, and contributions from the community. 
We’ve talked about how we’re going to chart this journey by using our data to synergise our three products through the Concept Graph. Now, we’re excited to share with you our first step towards that goal: our News Feed feature.
Through News Feed, we will provide readers with time-variant content that focuses on what our editors and writers cover, together with curated content from other sources – such as TechCrunch, Reuters and Recode for starters – that cover the tech scene in Asia and beyond, instead of a traditional list that orders the content in a reverse chronological manner. Fundamentally, we want our readers to have a meaningful engagement with our products – we’d like to give you access to content that covers topics that you’re interested in and care about.
Today, we’re excited to release News Feed on our Android and iOS apps. Right now, this is exclusively available on our mobile apps,  but we’ll be rolling it out progressively on our web application in the near future.

Why do we do this?
We are driven by our readers’ needs, so we’re constantly finding ways to serve you better. From readers’ surveys and research, we learned that our readers wanted more content and more depth in our articles. 
Our readers are hungry for more analysis and insights. Drawing from these findings, our team has worked tirelessly to make this happen.
We ran several experiments such as briefs, an article format where we summarized and shared links to great stories from other news sources. We also shared good content from other publishers on our social media channels. The goal was to deliver more quality content to our readers. As we concluded these experiments, we found out that summaries and content from other publishers were well received, and our readers derived value from the additional content.
That led us to think, how can we further scale this and deliver the most value to our users? We eventually came to an epiphany: Tech in Asia could be more than a newsroom – it could be a news distribution platform.
With the help of machines, we can curate and deliver more newsworthy content. That frees up our editorial team to dedicate itself to craft more in-depth content – something that the machines cannot create. This combination powers our News Feed, allowing us to give our readers a holistic view and deeper understanding of Asia’s tech ecosystem.
How do we do this?
Manual curation is inevitable here. However, we have devoted significant product and engineering efforts to make sure that our hardworking editorial team is not alone in this endeavor. We’ve adopted machine learning techniques to process content and establish the relationship and context among the articles using topic modeling – an unsupervised learning algorithm – that’s commonly used for understanding text and deriving higher-level insights. Using humans with domain expertise and an algorithm, we’re able to ensure that our content is relevant to readers.
How does the topic model work in the News Feed?
Topic model is a form of dimensional reduction technique that reduces high dimensional data to lower the number of dimensions with context about each of the derived dimensions. It decreases the words’ frequency in documents to clusters that are defined by the words. In this application, we’re able to derive a specified number of clusters of articles that have contextual relationships. 
With the topic model, it enables us to identify topics such as “Ride-hailing Services” which talks about “Uber”, “Grab”, and “Didi” as well as “Blockchain Technology” which covers “ICOs”, “Bitcoin” and “Cryptocurrencies”. Meanwhile, “Data”, “Machine Learning”, and “Analytics” are some of the elements that fall under “Artificial intelligence”. These topics are used to associate our articles with others, so you’ll see articles that are closely related to each other appear together in the feed.
 
Visualisation on how content from each source is covered by the topic model in planar form
The curated content have their topics derived from the model we developed and we associate them with our own articles based on how similar they are and how closely they are published together. Apps such as Flipboard have used topic models as well to achieve similar objectives.
Moving Forward
First of all, we want to understand how our editors curate content. Although we’re working on aggregating related content for the News Feed, its by-product is data on how editors select content that they think might be interesting and relevant to our readers. 
As content evolves with time, the topic model should evolve as well. We’ve just scratched the surface at this point, and we’re developing capabilities such as visualisation and human-based evaluation techniques to assist us in building models that can help teams grasp what’s happening around the world and use it as a catalyst to drive content strategy.
We’re also planning to develop a personalized feed based on your interests and reading habits. This will allow you to navigate through the streams of content easily and improve your content discovery experience.
We hope that you will find this feature useful, and we look forward to hearing your feedback as we work towards building a better product for you.

With the rise in mobile connectivity, it comes as no surprise how ecommerce has steadily grown to run the online consumer show, providing convenience, reach and efficiency to businesses and consumers alike.
This year, Tech in Asia Singapore 2018 takes a close look at five exhibiting ecommerce startups changing the consumer space through their products and services. Here’s a brief snippet of how these startups are taking on the growing goliath that is ecommerce.
Grouke

When it comes to making a purchase in a connected society, people have grown to rely less on their decision-making skills and instead focus on crowdsourcing their experiences and thoughts  with others to come up with a decision. This is why Grouke is aiming to redesign the digital consumer experience through the power of social influencing.
Equipped with their own set algorithm called “Flypers” and their user’s video reviews, Grouke’s ecommerce platform tweaks consumer experiences through their social networks’ shared reviews and preferences.
Awesell

In a highly competitive niche market such as dropshipping, it becomes quite tedious to manage scaling operations, especially when the diversification of products, and the communication between the suppliers all come into play at once.
Cue in Awesell, an ecommerce and workflow management app for dropshipping businesses. Their platform was created to help dropshipping businesses centralize managing and recording their products, customers, and shipment orders all in one convenient app. With their affordable pricing options and streamlined user interface, small to big businesses can benefit from Awesell’s shipment tracking, inventory management, and intuitive chat system in today’s fast-paced commerce environment.
Deal’n

With ecommerce, it’s easy to categorize consumers according to their preferences, interests, and historical purchases. But it’s quite often that we overlook those who have less to consume products. Deal’n bridges that gap between the traditional consumer market and the vulnerable members of our society, championing community over individualistic goals for profit.
With a platform that highlights the trading and sharing of useful skills, upcycled products and recycled products, Deal’n enables others to offer what would normally be difficult to sell or share, to something marketable for others to purchase, collaborate and benefit from.
Brambang

Although any kind of product could be sold online, fresh and local produce have yet to really catch on with their other conventional product counterparts. To help break that barrier, Brambang created their ecommerce platform to put the spotlight on locally gathered food.
What started as a platform to sell only one kind of fresh produce, Brambang has now expanded to multiple variations of meticulously sourced and selected vegetables, fruits, and even spices. Created with the sole goal of increasing the appeal and sales of indonesian agricultural products, the startup wants to support both buyers, suppliers, and sellers through the provision of an efficient and streamlined platform for affordable produce commerce.
Nidwork

Thinking of getting something done for an office space, or maybe for a house? With plenty of searching to do and calls to make to find the right designer, contractor, architect or even supplier, Nidwork aims to simplify the process of getting the right people for the job. Primarily serving the business-to-business market, Nidwork connects people within the construction and design industry with each other, multiple projects and various services in their platform.

34,"The CardUp team / Photo credit: CardUp
Do you ever wish you could use your credit card to pay for things like rent, taxes, or your employees’ salaries? CardUp founder and CEO Nicki Ramsay certainly did, and the Singapore-based fintech startup is the result of that wishful thinking. And it has managed to snag a seed round worth US$1.7 million by enabling users and businesses to do just that.
The round was led by Sequoia India and early-stage VC fund Seedplus. Barring an initial angel investment, this is the first time that CardUp has raised funding from institutional investors.
CardUp has created a website where users can set up recurring payments through their credit cards to pay rent, taxes, season parking, insurance, car loans, and more, that are usually made through bank transfers or checks. Transactions made through the platform this way go to recipients via bank transfer so that landlords, insurance firms, and the tax service don’t need to be enrolled on it themselves to get paid.
Businesses can use the platform to pay taxes, payroll, or suppliers in the same way. CardUp allows them to use their credit cards as a financing tool so that they have access to cash immediately, without having to apply for costly and time-consuming loans. They can then repay that credit simply by paying off their credit card bill.
Consumers and enterprise users have the additional incentive of earning rewards like rebates and air miles that traditionally come with credit card usage, but were not previously available to them for this kind of payments. The platform accepts “all major credit cards” in Singapore at the moment, and it has partnered with several banks and operators like Visa and Mastercard.
Small-business woes
Ramsay started CardUp in 2016, after spending most of her career in various roles at credit card operator American Express. During her stint, one of her goals was to spur more credit card usage, but one obstacle to growth she discovered was how some types of payments can’t really be made via cards. She herself was frustrated she couldn’t use them to pay off large expenses like rent.
Ramsay always had an entrepreneurial streak, and CardUp was one of several business ideas she had explored in the past. “They all got binned so they’re not worth talking about,” she jokes.
But the idea for CardUp was different. Through her corporate position, she had made the right connections and acquired the necessary expertise to give her the confidence to quit and start up. CardUp was part of Finlab’s inaugural fintech cohort in Singapore and cultivated early relationships with Mastercard as well as banks like United Overseas Bank and Citibank.
CardUp allows SMEs to use their credit cards as a financing tool so that they have access to cash without having to apply for costly and time-consuming loans.
The funding will help CardUp to further improve its business offering, which is aimed at small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Such companies often face problems with cash flow because of delayed payments from their customers. A survey by entrepreneurship agency SPRING Singapore found that three in five SMEs in the city-state have to deal with such delays, which affect their working capital.
CardUp wants to enable those businesses to secure a line of credit by using their credit cards on the platform to ensure cash flow. “We offer short-term financing solutions, which I think have been missing from the market,” Ramsay says. By just paying off their credit card bill, businesses have an easier time getting credit than seeking loans from financial institutions.
The website also offers invoicing tools and features such as automated recurring payments. Ramsay hopes that in this way, CardUp can be part of the initiative to digitize Singapore’s small businesses, which is spearheaded by Singapore’s Info-communications Media Development Authority.
CardUp is also looking to staff up. Recent key hires include Sandra Ernst, who was CEO of peer-to-peer invoice financing startup SmartFunding. Ernst left SmartFunding last summer, and joined CardUp as head of operations in late 2017.
CardUp is split between Singapore and India, where its tech team is based. That’s headed by Anand Nirgudkar, a software engineering veteran of 18 years. Nirgudkar was part of financial services tech firm Synechron and co-founded software solutions startup Ikigai Technology in India. Given the struggles that most startups face in finding technical talent in Singapore, the startup chose to build the tech team in Pune.

Splitting the bill
There’s one more startup in Singapore that helps businesses make payments with credit cards: iPaymy. It recently raised its own seed round worth US$1 million, from Beenext and DG Incubation. Ramsay says that CardUp differentiates itself by being available to consumers as well. iPaymy started out as a consumer product but pivoted to business customers based on user feedback, according to its founders.
CardUp’s consumer base has helped the company grow organically, through both user referrals and word of mouth online. The website been recommended by finance bloggers, while online forum users share tips like how to maximize rewards from CardUp’s platform. “That viral effect has been great to see, and it’s testament to the demand in the market,” says Ramsay. “It shows us we’re on the right track but also gives us insights as to what we should be building.”
CardUp’s automated payment tools are another differentiator. “We frequently hear this feedback from users, who can manage, edit, cancel or amend payments at any time from their dashboard,” Ramsay says, adding that this activity makes up 70 percent of all payments on the platform.
CardUp’s consumer base has helped the company grow organically, through both user referrals and word of mouth online.
Another potential issue with targeting the SME financing segment is a company with a bright green logo. Grab recently announced a lending and insurance program for small businesses, powered by its GrabPay digital wallet. While the service targets different clients than those of CardUp and iPaymy, it could eventually be a threat to them by virtue of sheer user base size.
Ramsay feels that customer segments are different enough between the companies for this to not be a concern. CardUp’s users already have access to credit cards and bank accounts and are more interested in the recurring payments offering for their rent, tuition fees, taxes, and so on. Grab’s product, as it stands now, focuses on underbanked users in Southeast Asia. Plus, CardUp’s service only requires the payer to be signed up for the platform to be useful.
Ramsay didn’t share specific details about CardUp’s revenue and active users. But she says the latter number is in the “thousands” and that the growth rate of users (consumer and business combined) has been 41 percent month-on-month since the startup launched.
In the past year, the startup says that over US$42 million in payments have been made through the platform, which accounted for a 1 percent growth in credit card spending in Singapore from 2016 to 2017.

Here’s a wrap of the day’s news.
Transportation
Uber confirms sale of Southeast Asian business to Grab (Singapore). The ride-hailing company has announced the sale of its Southeast Asia business, including its food-delivery service UberEats, to Grab yesterday. The deal hands Uber a 27.5 percent stake in its local rival and the US firm’s second exit from a major market in Asia. In 2016, China’s Didi purchased Uber’s business in the country. (Reuters)
Xiaoming Bike to file for bankruptcy after failing to pay deposits (China). Consumers in China may soon lose their deposits if the bike-sharing company files for bankruptcy. The bike-sharing firm failed to separate users’ deposits from its company account, which resulted in a total of 2,952 user complaints filed with Guangdong Consumer Council. The council ordered the startup to return the money and apologize to the public. (China Money Network)
Delivery and logistics
Grab poised to be region’s food-delivery mammoth after Uber SEA buy (Singapore). Uber’s sale of its Southeast Asia business to Grab includes UberEats, the US company’s food-delivery unit, which ranks well on app stores in Singapore and Malaysia. Grab runs its own food-delivery operations called GrabFood in Thailand and Indonesia. It will expand across Southeast Asia by next quarter. (Tech in Asia)
Fintech
Singapore and Japan cooperate to grow fintech (Singapore). In a joint statement on Monday, the Singapore FinTech Association (SFA) and the Fintech Association of Japan (FAJ) pledged to boost cooperation. The associations will work on joint projects on fintech innovation and development, and benefit from each other’s expertise. Japan recently updated its laws to allow banks and fintech companies to collaborate. (Straits Times)
First fintech debuts on Singapore’s stock market (Singapore). Ayondo, a global fintech group, is the first fintech company to appear on the Singapore Exchange. It enters with a value of US$0.18 a piece – 7.7 percent lower than its initial public offering. Ayondo offers social trading and brokerage services through its platforms, WeTrade and Tradehub. (Business Times)
Blockchain and cryptocurrencies
China leads in blockchain patent application (China). In 2017, the country filed 225 blockchain patents, more than half of the global total of 406 applications, according to data from Thomson Reuters. The runner-up was the US at 91 applications. China’s applications ranged from cryptocurrency to chicken tracking, though China’s still behind the curve on bitcoin and digital currency applications, an area dominated by US and European companies. (Financial Times)
Malaysian mobile marketplace gets on the blockchain train (Malaysia). ServisHero has announced a decentralisation of its system to allow for more efficient internal operations. It allows homeowners to search and hire service providers to do cleaning, plumbing, or electrical wiring, to name a few. The company claims blockchain also adds transparency to worker reputation scores, making them more credible. An initial coin offering is in the pipeline. (ServisHero)
Ecommerce
Alibaba in talks with Thai government to open logistics center (Thailand). The Chinese tech giant is reportedly eyeing a logistics hub in Chachoengsao, which the Thai government plans to develop into a leading economic zone. This move comes at the heels of a recent US$2 billion investment in ecommerce firm Lazada and last year’s opening of an electronic trading center Kuala Lumpur. Alibaba wants to use Thailand as a base to launch in Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, and Vietnam, said Thailand’s industry minister. (South China Morning Post)
Social media
Singapore passes media blackout law to ban photos or videos during crises (Singapore). The city-state passed a controversial law in parliament that blocks any form of electronic communication during a terror attack – a move that has sparked concerns about press freedom. Local police can stop anyone in the vicinity from posting photos, videos, or updates of what transpired. In September 2016, the Singapore government launched SG Secure, an app that crowdsources photos and information from affected individuals during a terrorist attack. The city-state is ranked 151 out of 180 countries on media watchdog Reporters Without Borders’ World Press Freedom Index. (South China Morning Post)

The business world is reeling from Grab’s purchase of Uber’s Southeast Asian business. The stakes are high: Grab is battling to become the de facto mobile platform in the region, and this struggle will shape the regional economy for years to come. Here, I tease out the winners and losers in this gigantic chess move.
Winner: Grab
Grab comes out looking good. Not many people can say, “I’ve beaten a Silicon Valley giant.” As I’ve mentioned in a previous article, the consolidation allows Grab to focus its efforts on battling other competitors.
Loser: Grab’s competitors
It’s now or never for Go-Jek, Grab’s Indonesian rival whose success is so far confined to its country of origin. It’s the same story for food-delivery rivals Honestbee, Foodpanda, and Deliveroo, who find themselves suddenly facing a monster with unlimited resources.
Grab is set to collide with the tech giants of the world for dominance in Southeast Asia. Sea is investing heavily in its ecommerce app Shopee and payments solution AirPay. Amazon expanded to Singapore but hasn’t hinted at a game plan for the region. Alibaba is doubling down on Southeast Asia by overhauling Lazada, whose new boss previously ran Ant Financial.
Winner: Uber
In an ideal world, this is not the outcome Uber wanted. But at least in terms of pure dollars and cents, it’s set to reap a profit. In an email to employees, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi explained that the company invested US$700 million in the region but now has a 27.5 percent stake in Grab that is worth billions. If Grab continues to do well, Uber could benefit even more.
Loser: Consumers and drivers
Consumers seem skeptical. Grab’s app experience seems to pale compared to Uber’s. As subsidies wind down and Grab enjoys its monopoly position, its rides could become more expensive. While this may not happen in the end, it’s a sentiment Grab will have to fight.
Meanwhile, some Uber drivers are lost and confused about the merger, Today reported. Attempts by some drivers to contact Lion City Rentals, the car rental firm owned by Uber, went unanswered. The future of these drivers seems murky too. Fewer subsidies could mean that either drivers receive less income, or consumers pay more for rides which affect demand and hurt drivers.
“Uber has sent out messages with specific sign up details to all their drivers in Singapore. Grab will be reaching out to drivers in the coming days to ensure they have everything they need to transition over to Grab,”a spokesperson told Tech in Asia.
Winner: SoftBank
SoftBank got the outcome it wanted. As an investor in both Grab and Uber, it’s no longer in the awkward position of backing both rivals. With Grab and Uber focused on winning their respective home markets, SoftBank can maximize its returns.
Loser: Some of Uber Southeast Asia’s employees
Consolidation between firms lead to greater efficiency, but that inevitably results in staff attrition. Lazada lost hundreds of employees when Alibaba took control. Grab will offer new roles to all 500-plus affected Uber staff, who are now on paid leave. “On the part of Grab, we are committed to try and find everyone a home at Grab,” the spokesman said.
However, some may not find the eventual offers attractive. There’s also the C-word: culture. There’s no guarantee that the combined teams will gel.
Winner: Southeast Asia’s startup ecosystem
Grab’s success will fuel more investments into startups in Singapore and the region. For starters, Grab’s early investors, like 500 Startups, Vertex Ventures, and GGV Capital, will have reaped their rewards and bolster their case for investing even more money in the region’s startups.
Likewise, Grab’s founding team and early employees would profit handsomely from its rise, and some of that money would go towards angel investments. Some Grab alumni may start the next generation of tech companies.
Ultimately, Grab’s success proves that local players, given the right circumstances, can beat global giants.

39,"All of One Championship’s live fights will soon be streaming on its own mobile app / Photo credit: One Championship
One Championship, a major Singapore-based organizer and broadcaster of its own martial arts competition, is now setting its sights on launching a YouTube-like service for the martial arts world. It will release a video streaming app in early May, revealed founder and CEO Chatri Sityodtong to Tech in Asia. The app will feature its own martial arts content as well as related licensed material, including movies and other competitions.
The Sequoia- and Temasek-backed media company has largely focused on sports promotion, with live martial arts events and TV broadcasting. For its transformation into streaming, it set up its own engineering team in Bangalore under the guidance of investor Sequoia India.
One Championship estimates there is more than a billion martial arts fans it can potentially reach through mobile streaming. “The NBA has 8 million subscribers on YouTube,” Sityodtong tells Tech in Asia. “If we don’t get 8 million downloads right away, I’ll be shocked.” He adds that the company expects “a few hundred million” users in the first two to three years of the app rolling out, given “the size of Asia and the relevance of martial arts.”
The company rose to prominence in Asia through its mixed martial arts events but Sityodtong wants One Championship to represent martial arts in general. The brand will be adding more martial arts promotions and fights under its umbrella, like kickboxing, karate, and more, and making them available on the app.
It also hopes to eventually include martial arts movies and shows beyond just fights – it already has some online shows of its own. Sityodtong hopes to make the app an all-around destination for fans and practitioners of martial arts.
The Sequoia effect
One Championship raised an undisclosed amount last year in a series C round co-led by Mission Holdings and Sequoia India – a deal that closed in under 10 weeks, an unusually short time in Asia, where such deals can take more than six months to close.
The involvement of Sequoia, a venture capital firm that’s known for its tech investments, seemed even more unusual. It turns out that the firm was instrumental in driving this tech initiative for One Championship.
Making the content available for free on the app was Sequoia India managing director Shailendra Singh’s idea, Sityodtong says. “My jaw dropped – I thought he was joking,” he chuckles. “Then I realized he was serious.”
Singh sees working with founders to help evolve the business or offer a different perspective as a core part of Sequoia’s job. “In this case, we had ideas about re-imagining the sports media market, using insights on live video streaming and [user-generated content] trends that we are witnessing in China,” he tells Tech in Asia. “These quickly resonated with Chatri and we all got aligned on this very fast.”
Sequoia was instrumental in driving this tech initiative for One Championship.
The venture capital firm loaned its director of technology, Anandamoy Roychowdhary – a veteran from companies like Zynga and Symantec – to oversee the project, and  its UX design head, Abhishek Ghate, drove the initial look and feel of the product. Roychowdhary and Sequoia’s human resources team scouted and recruited people for One Championship’s engineering team in Bangalore, according to Sityodtong.
That’s how One Championship’s own CTO, Mahesh Subramanian, was brought aboard. Subramanian has worked in online video since 2009, when he co-founded video streaming startup Touchfone Technologies. The startup and its streaming platform, StrmEasy, were acquired by Delhi-based ScoopWhoop Media in 2016.
The engineering team, based in Sequoia’s Bangalore offices, is close to 20-strong and growing. Besides the app, the team is exploring potential augmented and virtual reality applications.
“We did have a roadmap for technology but it wasn’t the highest sense of urgency,” Sityodtong says. “Without Sequoia’s help, there’s no way we could have gotten so far this fast.”
Singh likens the way Sequoia worked with One Championship to how it worked with Indonesian unicorn Go-Jek. The VC referred key staff to the ride-hailing startup like CTOs Ajay Gore and Niranjan Paranjpe, engineering head Sidu Ponnapa, and VP of engineering Sudhanshu Raheja.

Sports on phones
Sityodtong thinks that his company’s offering is a good fit for mobile platforms. “72 percent of our matches end within a few minutes,” he explains. “This is perfect for short-form content on a mobile device. You’re not going to watch a 90-minute soccer game on [a phone].”
Sports and entertainment properties usually make their content available online on a subscription or pay-per-view basis. By retaining streaming rights and making its own productions available for free, One Championship is going down a different path that resembles players like YouTube and Twitch (which was acquired by Amazon for US$970 million in 2014).
It makes the app the main point of contact with its audience, the “center of our universe,” as Sityodtong puts it. “The idea is to get that community going via content,” the CEO says. Once the user base is there, it’s a matter of monetizing it, whether through advertising or other means.
The proliferation of smartphones in Asia has helped propel mobile streaming as the entertainment medium of choice.
The proliferation of smartphones in Asia has helped propel mobile streaming as the entertainment medium of choice. This ranges from peer-to-peer live streaming platforms like Singapore’s BeLive and China’s Inke to video streaming apps like Hooq, Iflix, Viddsee, and Toggle. Video providers can also clinch deals with telcos, who can offer mobile data packages and distribute content for free or at a discount for subscribers.
The online video market in Asia is projected to be worth US$46 billion by 2022, according to a report by consultancy Media Partners Asia. This is up from US$17.6 billion in 2017 and includes revenues from advertising and subscription fees, says the firm. China accounts for more than half of that projection but smaller markets in Southeast Asia are riding on aforementioned tie-ups with telcos for growth.
Sports streaming is also getting more popular. For example, British live sports streaming service DAZN, which secured the rights to Japan’s J. League soccer games, plans to move into Southeast Asia by 2020.
One Championship’s position in Asia’s martial arts scene means it can be a first mover in its niche.
Talent hunting
Ever since its series C round, One Championship has been on a headhunting spree, beefing up its management team with hires like TPG Capital principal Hua Fung Teh as CFO. “We’re building up the intellectual horsepower of the company to scale it globally,” Sityodtong says.
Having raised just over US$100 million in total from investors like Sequoia, Mission Holdings, and Temasek subsidiary Heliconia Capital, One Championship currently has seven offices around Asia and is opening an eighth in Tokyo soon.
Sityodtong hopes to take One Championship public within the next three years, depending on market conditions and the company’s own financial performance. He says the potential options are New York, Hong Kong, or Singapore.

A forced marriage, a loveless union, and mysterious disappearances.
All these are red flags in a relationship, but thankfully they’re just plot developments in Rindu Awak 200% (I miss you 200 %), a Malay television drama broadcasted nationwide in 2014.
“The show was so memorable and featured actors like Zul Ariffin. Mass Malays loved it,” says Ben Jern Loh, general manager of Tonton, a video streaming service under Kuala Lumpur-headquartered Media Prima Berhad. “It’s one of our top 10 shows being streamed,” he adds.
A decade ago, TV show spoilers wouldn’t have happened because original content broadcasted on television wouldn’t be released online. But now, people can finish entire seasons in one sitting using video streaming services. “Consumption habits are changing and people want to finish entire seasons of a show without waiting for the television,” says Loh.
Netflix, YouTube, Tonton, and Iflix are examples of over-the-top (OTT) services: media content provided via the internet. These new options have changed viewing patterns, with audiences moving from television screens to desktops, and then to mobile phones. This shift also has an impact on how ads are served – ad spend on digital media is increasing and beat TV ad spend in 2017.

Seeking alternative advertising revenue
In 2017, Media Prima lost about US$26 million in the third quarter because of a drop in television and print advertising revenue.
However, Loh confirms that they saw a 38 percent growth in revenue in 2017 on the back of increasing engagement rates and subscriptions on Tonton.
As such, it’s no surprise that the company is setting its sights on other options, such as digital advertising and subscription revenue.
“TV is incredible for reaching large audiences at one go and provides a general audience profile breakdown based on station’s strategy or the segment’s theme,” explains Loh. But Tonton’pitch was that advertisers could now target audiences beyond large numbers, but drill down to their behavior and even individual profiles.
Doing this was not without risk. But the promise of increased revenue gave Tonton an edge in the boardroom. According to Loh, Media Prima’s top-level management was confident about creating the service. “We knew this was the future,” he recalls.
Rolling the dice on OTT service
When it was first launched in August 2010, Tonton was just meant to stream some TV channels online and help audiences catch up on shows.
Still, the service had to be custom built from ground up.
Back then, building a technology service from scratch was far more expensive. Tonton declines to reveal how much it cost to build the new product.
“Seven to eight years down the line, costs have gone down because of economies of scale. The cost of streaming technology has also gone down since 2010,” says Loh.
Around April 2014, Media Prima switched from a custom solution to Ooyala, an online video platform for Tonton’s live streaming and video-on-demand needs. This was significantly more efficient, provided better insights, and was cost-effective as the components were purpose-built for the OTT industry.
The change was followed by April 2016’s launch of a completely redesigned Tonton – it would no longer be a completely free ad-supported service in Malaysia.
“I think the most difficult part was converting the 5.5 million users then, and telling them that Tonton was no longer 100 percent free,” recounts Loh. “It was scary because we didn’t know how users would react.”
Based on previous experiments with video credits, the team decided on the basic price point of about US$0.70 for a 24-hour subscription. At present, a year’s subscription costs about US$25.
To convince users to sign up, Tonton gave out free one-month subscriptions to existing users and experimented with getting the right mix of free and paid content.
Sarah Ismail says she became a member right away after watching a Tonton ad on television about a year ago. “I was quite excited and paid about US$2.54 (MYR10) in the first month.”
The 25-year-old account executive uses Tonton to watch Malay dramas in high definition, such as Ariana Rose and Ku Kirim Cinta. She also uses YouTube and Netflix for other types of content.
Her mother, a “hardcore Malay drama fan,” “just binge-watches through the night.”

Some premium shows and un-aired content are only available for paid users. Upcoming exclusives include content created by popular Southeast Asian YouTube creators Jinnyboy and TheMingThing.
While Loh couldn’t reveal more details, he hints that upcoming content takes some inspiration from Netflix’s Black Mirror.
Microscopic targeting now possible
With the business model locked down, Tonton had to take a harder look at its ads.
The group had started a data-driven ad targeting process on Tonton when it was first launched in 2010.
Big tech brands such as Samsung and Panasonic as well as fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) behemoths like Procter & Gamble joined in. “The sales team said, ‘Let’s place your ad on Tonton.’ We had to educate advertisers [on Tonton’s reach],” shares Loh.
Advertisers can no longer rely on the same 30-second commercials on TV. “The optimal way is to customize the message so that users can engage with the ad better,” observes Loh.
Whether audiences engage with ads meaningfully depends on their length and message. Digital ads need to be short – sometimes, as brief as 10 seconds.
They also need to drive at immediate conversion rather than just national awareness.
For instance, on top of hearing about a new product over traditional media, viewers should have a way to receive a promotion code or a coupon such as via clicking a button.
Loh says, “[Advertisers] get the reach, the eyeballs and the pluses of the digital world, but what [they] need is a bit more engagement so that users will immediately go, ‘Oh, yeah! Get a discount!'”
Joshua Tan, a digital media specialist at integrated advertising agency DigitasLBi, points out, “If you are watching an ad on YouTube, it’s right before the video you signed up to watch or clicked on.” Viewers could simply skip the ad if they are not interested.
“So, if you have some interactivity, that helps if your messaging or creative is compelling and all the elements come together to reach out to the right audience,” says Tan.
The level of ad targeting Tonton is equipped to do is granular. For instance, it can reach females between age 18 and 25 who are specifically talking about Justin Bieber through Media Prima’s digital advertising platform called Audience+.
Tonton is also working on another level of ad targeting through Camment, an AI-powered video chat plug-in with face and voice recognition.
While Camment is meant for users to leave video notes for their friends while watching a show, the plug-in also remembers how users look like, which enables it to serve targeted ads.
For example, a male user with a beard talks about David Beckham over Camment. The AI will recognize the user’s gender and facial features. The user will then be served ads targeted at adult males with mustaches, such as Gillette razors or electric shavers.
Exploring new channels of advertising
For advertisers, the best part about technology is how it allows them to swoop in and curate their own channels or reels of content with just a click of a button.
A Kantar Millward Brown study commissioned by Hulu in October 2016 found that OTT ads were more effective at increasing brand awareness and brand favorability compared to desktop and mobile ads.
To create a traditional broadcast channel, media companies need to get through red tape. But advertisers can create virtual TV channels on OTT services such as Tonton.
“If users were to go on Tonton right now, chances are, they may see one or two cooking shows,’’says Loh. They would also have to dive deeper to find more shows. In contrast, Loh contends that “if a cooking company came to us [to curate a cooking channel], people who love cooking get a channel without having to manually search for cooking shows!”
With close to 35,000 hours of content, Tonton has an extensive inventory of dramas and movies that can help brands run campaigns based on any theme through virtual stations. This isn’t possible with regular TV.

OTT services can help TV ratings
More people are watching shows online, but surprisingly, Loh says Tonton doesn’t eat into Media Prima’s TV ratings. This is mainly because TV users and internet users appear to be separate groups who have different viewing patterns.
“Ratings for TV did not drop,” he shares. In fact, the service helps to promote content organically.
Ratings for traditional TV did not drop.
In line with this, Tonton allows their 7.8 million users to watch shows six months before it’s broadcasted on TV. In turn, these internet-savvy viewers would promote the shows – on their own, without any prompting or inducement.
“After watching [a show], they start talking about it in their social space. They tell their mother and father, they go on Twitter and talk. We are essentially laying the groundwork for the TV network. By the time the show hits TV, it already has runway,” explains Loh.
People who prefer to watch television could simply wait for the show to be broadcasted, while people who demand the content immediately or prefer exclusive Tonton-only content could subscribe to Tonton. Usually, those more likely to subscribe to on-demand services such as Tonton watch shows for their favorite actors and actresses, according to Loh.

While he acknowledges how widespread online streaming services have become, Loh thinks Tonton has carved its own niche.
“You have Netflix, Amazon Prime video. Everyone has their niches, [but] we aren’t necessarily competitors. If you get Iflix [for Hollywood content], you may still subscribe to Tonton if you want the best of Malaysian content,” he argues.
“That’s the [content] mix we’re aiming at today,” concludes Loh.

41,"Xiaomi’s flagship store in Shenzhen. Image credit: Xiaomi
In February, Huami, the major wearable maker for Xiaomi, held its US$110 million initial public offering in New York. The flotation came amid rumors of a listing for Xiaomi itself, reminding us that the Chinese giant’s ambition doesn’t stop at smartphones.
Back in 2013, Xiaomi spotted the Internet of Things wave and responded with a five-year plan to invest in 100 hardware startups. They would feed Xiaomi with an ecosystem of products surrounding smartphones, such as power banks and internet-connected devices like air purifiers. But now, the giant has broadened its horizon by funding lifestyle projects from toothbrushes to suitcases.
These startups get a hand from Xiaomi to grow, and a number of them have flourished under its wings. By the end of 2015, four companies, including Huami, had reached unicorn status with billion-dollar valuations. By 2017, the ecosystem had 99 startups and booked US$3.16 billion in annual revenue.
There’s a saying in China’s startup circle: If a consumer product wants to get support to grow rapidly, join the Xiaomi ecosystem. But doing so could compromise a startup’s independence.
Joining the rocket ship
Xiaomi’s ecosystem strategy, as the company describes it, is a marriage of funding and incubation for startups.
To begin with, Xiaomi maintains an internal troop of experienced product managers – most of whom are engineers – to hunt for teams who could build its next best-selling device. And these teams must share the company’s vision of building high-quality products with low price tags.
This is what Xiaomi did when it started offering smartphones: It accepted low margins and cut distribution costs by selling solely online. The phones took China by storm. In 2014, the then four-year-old firm toppled Samsung’s leading position in China with a 12.5 percent market share.
The giant invests in startups with mutual interests – taking a non-controlling share of below 50 percent – and helps them get off the ground. Revenues are then divided between Xiaomi and its investees.
“Taking non-controlling shares means that we are leaving maximum interests to the startups,” said Liu De, co-founder and vice president of Xiaomi, in a previous speech. “Under this system, you will find that they are much more incentivized and willing to fight on the front line.”
If a consumer product wants to get much-needed support to grow rapidly, join the Xiaomi ecosystem. But doing so could compromise a startup’s independence. 
Taking off
The resources Xiaomi allocates to startups vary from case to case. But most come down to two areas: brand and distribution. These startups then gain the reputation that Xiaomi has built up over the years: value for money.
The product also gets access to a massive distribution network via Xiaomi’s online store, app, and, more recently, its 300 offline stores – a move that Xiaomi started in 2015 to confront slowing ecommerce growth in China. In 2016, Xiaomi ranked as the fifth largest business-to-consumer online retailer in China, which came as a surprise to many. After all, Xiaomi was mainly known as a smartphone brand.
“Customers trust the quality of Xiaomi’s products, and the traffic [the ecosystem startups] get without advertising spend also allows for a price advantage,” Benjamin Joffe, general partner at hardware accelerator HAX, tells Tech in Asia.
Some startups – especially those with greater revenue contribution to Xiaomi, such as manufacturers of headphones, power banks, and wearables – are paired with project managers who share know-how in design, supply chain, pricing, branding, and fundraising.
“What Xiaomi values most are smartphones, followed by smartphones accessories, internet-connected devices, and lastly, daily and entertainment products,” explains co-founder of Poputar Luo Shichuan to Tech in Asia.

Poputar, which makes smart ukuleles, joined Xiaomi’s ecosystem last year. Being in the “less important” category that targets a niche audience, the startup doesn’t get assigned to product managers. Instead, it receives the minimum benefits of funding and distribution that come with joining the Xiaomi band.
Wearables maker Huami, on the other hand, got hands-on help from Liu early on, the founder Huang Wang recalls in a blog post. In 2014, the Huami-made, Xiaomi-branded Mi Band launched into the Chinese market for only US$12, while its American rival Fitbit was priced from US$60 to US$250. The next year, Xiaomi became the world’s second largest wearable brand following Fitbit.
Customers trust the quality of Xiaomi’s products, and the traffic the ecosystem startups get without advertising spend also allows for a price advantage. 
Hoverboard maker Ninebot also reaped great rewards from Xiaomi. In 2015, Xiaomi participated in Ninebot’s US$80 million buyout of its better-known American rival Segway, and the deal brought Ninebot over 400 “critical patents” and a “significant” market share in its category.
The drawbacks
While the Xiaomi ecosystem offers huge perks, it has constraints.
One Shenzhen-based hardware maker who requested anonymity told Tech in Asia that it decided not to join Xiaomi because the “margins were simply too low.” But this could change over time as startups scale. Huami’s gross margin has been rising steadily from 12.3 percent in 2015 to 25.3 percent for the nine months ended September 2017, according to the company’s IPO prospectus.
Moreover, low margins don’t necessarily get in the way when it comes to fundraising. “Having Xiaomi’s endorsement and a good development model are enough to move investors,” says Wendy Wang, CEO and co-founder of hardware ecommerce platform VeeShop, whose vendors include Xiaomi portfolio companies.
The bigger concern is over-dependence on Xiaomi for branding and distribution. Despite Huami’s sizable market share, its own Amazfit brand makes up a rather small fraction of its total sales. Xiaomi wearable products contributed 97.1 percent, 92.1 percent, and 82.4 percent of Huami’s total revenues for 2015, 2016, and the nine months ended September 2017, respectively.
That means Huami’s success, at this stage, relies overwhelmingly on Xiaomi. “Xiaomi is our most important customer and distribution channel. Any deterioration of our relationship with Xiaomi or reduction of sales of Xiaomi wearable products could have a material adverse effect on our operating results,” admits Huami.
Xiaomi cherishes its own brand. If an ecosystem product has bad quality, it damages the Xiaomi brand as well. 
Ching Mi, which chiefly produces power strips, earned 99 percent of its total sales through Xiaomi’s distribution channels when it went public in China two years ago.
These companies are essentially making commodities, for which “brand recognition and low-cost distribution are key to their survival,” argues Joffe of HAX. “Their dependency on Xiaomi for both means makes an M&A exit to anyone else but Xiaomi quite unlikely.”
Nonetheless, Xiaomi’s vested interests in these startups could drive it to keep them from failing. “Xiaomi cherishes its own brand. If an ecosystem product has bad quality, it damages the Xiaomi brand as well,” says Luo.
However, not all ecosystem members rely on Xiaomi to survive. Poputar, for instance, gets most of its sales from outside channels like Tmall and JD. Unlike the early-day ecosystem startups – many of whom started from zero – Poputar had a steady income flow prior to its Xiaomi adventure.
Indeed, the giant is funding more companies like Poputar, which are further away from its smartphone legacy and get by without its help. The move not only broadens the inventory of Xiaomi’s supermall, but also provides a testing ground for an unknown category that could make it big someday.

Grab’s pivotal purchase of Uber’s Southeast Asian business is now official. Here are the details:

Grab has bought Uber’s ride-hailing business as well as its food-delivery business, Uber Eats. That’s major.
Grab will take over Uber Eats’ operations immediately.
As part of the deal, Uber now owns 27.5 percent of Grab. The stake roughly reflects Uber’s share of the ride-hailing market, which is around a quarter, a Grab spokesperson told Tech in Asia.
By next quarter, Grab will expand its food-delivery service, GrabFood, to the rest of Southeast Asia. It currently operates in Thailand and Indonesia.
In 2017, Grab grew 2.5 times in app downloads and four times in the number of driver-partners.
All Uber employees will receive offers to join Grab, the spokesman confirmed.

The deal gives Grab a ride-hailing monopoly in the region. It ends costly discount battles against Uber, allowing Grab to focus on chipping away at Go-Jek and GoPay’s lead in Indonesia, a must-win market.
Foodpanda, Honestbee, and Deliveroo should be worried.
The biggest coup, however, is arguably the food-delivery business. Uber Eats competes strongly against its rivals, having snagged McDonald’s as a partner restaurant chain. It’s ranking especially well in the app stores in Singapore and Malaysia. Foodpanda, Honestbee, and Deliveroo should be worried.
For Grab, transportation is just the beginning. Although high-volume, the margins are razor-thin unless you can get rid of the drivers and replace them with AI. Food delivery works the same way. Like travel, food is a daily necessity. Grab probably won’t make a lot of money off food delivery, but that’s not the point.
By owning the platforms that serve two major consumer needs, Grab can collect a treasure trove of data that will allow it to shed its label of a ride-hailing firm and become the dominant ecommerce platform in Southeast Asia.
Key to its ambitions is building out all the infrastructure, a necessity in the region’s rising economies. It began with its e-wallet GrabPay, which is now a mode of payment for many merchants in Singapore, not to mention the actual rides on Grab.
It then moved into financial services when it announced that it will offer loans and insurance products to its driver and merchant network. This will grease Grab’s network and keep the transactions flowing.
Financial services could also be where Grab makes its money. Because there’s no need to expand a physical delivery network as the business grows, the marginal cost of expanding its loans and insurance offerings is arguably lower compared with rides and food delivery.
Further, many labor-intensive functions of a financial services business can be automated. Credit scoring and claims are just two examples. With a ready customer base on the Grab network, the cost of sales can be reduced.
Treasure trove of data
Now with Uber Eats in the fold, consumers will have another compelling reason to use GrabPay, and Grab will have more customers to sell its financial services to.
The consumer data is key. Grab will have insight into consumer behavior that not even the tech giants and traditional institutions have. This gives it an advantage. Ecommerce giants like Amazon have transaction data, but they can’t collate consumer travel patterns like Grab can.
Banks and insurance firms are probably sweating right now. While they have some understanding of consumer consumption patterns, they won’t be able to know, for example, a consumer’s favorite food or travel habits, let alone collate the data into market trends that will benefit Grab’s ecosystem. Grab could beat them in certain segments of the loans and insurance business.
Grab still faces a lot of uncertainty in the years ahead. Will governments block Grab’s monopoly? Can it properly govern its use of consumer data and prevent a privacy fiasco from developing (like what’s happening now with Facebook)? Can it win in Indonesia? Can it compete against Alibaba and Tencent in Southeast Asia, which are arguably the originators of Grab’s current strategy?
With subsidies winding down, consumer usage may follow suit. Yet Grab can’t keep the prices of its rides too low because it needs to pay drivers enough to keep them happy. Its loans business is also far from a guaranteed success. Grab needs to amass enough borrowers with strong credit scores and minimize the number of defaults which it will then have to write off.
My money is on an eventual mega-consolidation with a Chinese giant firmly in the mix, which will certainly set the stage for a reckoning between states and the private sector down the line.

46,"

It’s well known that nine out of ten startups fail within their first few years of incorporation. The second most cited reason for their failures, unsurprisingly, is the lack of capital.
One of the most common ways for startups to raise funds is through VCs, but with the growing streams of funding available, what does it mean for the relationship between startups and VCs?
Have these burning questions and more answered at Tech in Asia Singapore 2018’s panel on VCs, laws and legislation across SEA this May 15 at the Main Stage. The session brings together key stakeholders such as government agencies, investors, and startups, to discuss the roles of different players in the ecosystem, and how they can prepare themselves for the future.
Read on below to find out what we’ve got lined up for this panel session!
ICOs and the city
Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) have become a popular fundraising option – in 2017 alone, blockchain companies raised close to US$4 billion, and the trend seems set to continue this year. With ICOs being a low-cost option because they do not require any intermediaries and take a shorter time compared to raising capital traditionally through VCs, what does the future hold for both startups and VCs?
Dive into topics such as:

How do ICOs affect traditional VC funding?
How much has raising funds from ICOs affect how startups see funding sources?
Is investing in ICOs a stable form of investment?
What do startups need to know before diving into ICOs?

How do investors work with ICOs?
With the rise of token sales, does it mean that VCs are no longer needed? Many have argued that while ICOs provide the capital, VCs are still the ones who bring connections, expertise and advice to the table. How can investors prepare themselves for the future to work alongside ICOs?
As ICOs are still relatively new, governments have intervened, setting regulations and safeguards for those investing in them. While China has proclaimed a blanket ban on ICOs, countries such as Singapore and Switzerland are popular countries for ICO campaigns.
The following topics will be covered:

What other countries might be on track to ban ICOs in 2018?
How will the ban of ICOs affect you and your portfolio companies?
What actions should VCs take to prepare for the possibility of the ban of ICOs?

Laws and legislation across SEA
Government policies and regulations have a huge role to play in influencing the business environment and economic development of a nation. A stable political system can promote local businesses, and appeal to foreign investors, while tax increases may discourage investments. How do the laws and legislation across SEA affect startups, VCs and other stakeholders?
Glean insights as we discuss topics such as:

The role of government regulators in shaping the VC landscape
What are some laws that have recently passed/been lifted that affects you?
How does the recent changes in laws affect startups?

Is there saturation of VCs in the landscape?
According to a report by KPMG, the last quarter of 2017 saw the third strongest quarter of VC investment of the decade, despite plummeting deal volume – are there too many VCs, chasing too few ideas? There has been criticisms that money is directed at successful companies scaling up, instead of going towards early stage startups that are in need of capital.
Last year, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) simplified the regulatory framework for VC managers in Singapore, and reduced compliance costs and time taken for the application process. By doing so, MAS hopes it will attract more VC managers and encourage them to play a greater role in supporting innovation and entrepreneurship.
Key takeaways include:

How startups can do their due diligence to pick out good VC managers
How does relaxed regulations affect existing VCs?

The biggest problem with blockchain platforms right now can be illustrated by a simple analogy.
At the beginning of the 21st century, the internet was incredibly slow. If you had a blog back then, it would have been both time-consuming and expensive for users to access it.
People noticed the problem, but they also recognized the usefulness of the internet. To resolve this, they worked on improving the internet’s infrastructure and design. At the same time, they built better hardware to run important elements of the internet as we know it today.
Because of these changes, the internet became faster, and the costs of accessing websites became much lower. Before, developers were only able to create a single web page. But after the changes, developers could now build sites like Facebook, Google, and Twitter on the improved infrastructure. All this is possible because the internet is now very fast and scalable.
At present, blockchain transactions face a similar hurdle: they’re slow and expensive.
Blockchain companies are working to provide scalable infrastructure so that blockchain platforms can become mainstream in future. Once this happens, not only can people use blockchain for payment purposes, but they can also build applications similar to Google and Facebook on top of them.
Zilliqa is one of the companies seeking a solution to this problem.
Tech in Asia sat down with Yaoqi Jia, head of technology at Zilliqa, to find out more.
Blockchain and the problem of scalability
The problem of scalability cannot be explained without first explaining the idea of throughput.
Image credit: Susi Susanti
Imagine you are at a train station. Trains here come in one-hour intervals, and only 10 people can fit inside. Once the train fills up, the eleventh passenger will have to wait for the next one.
Using this example, passengers represent transactions. Popular blockchain platforms like bitcoin and ethereum can process around 10 transactions per second on average.
Image credit: Susi Susanti
In contrast, payment companies like Visa currently process around 5,000 to 8,000 transactions per second on average.
The rate at which transactions are processed is called its throughput. Blockchain platforms currently have a drastically lower throughput compared to payment platforms like Visa.
Image credit: Susi Susanti
Now imagine you are at the same train station, but this time with a hundred other people who want to take the same train. The train arrives. The conductor looks at the crowd and says, “The 10 people who can pay the most for the ticket will get to board the train.” You’re in a rush, so you pay a huge sum of money for your ticket and board the train.
Due to the low throughput of blockchain platforms, transaction fees rise. For instance, a $10 transaction can easily have an added transaction fee of $2 on the more congested blockchain platforms today.
As such, the slow speeds and high costs for transactions on blockchain platforms are huge barriers for mainstream transactions to take place on these platforms today.
Increasing the scalability
For mainstream adoption of blockchain platforms, these platforms need to scale. Blockchain companies have come up with several solutions for this.
1. Increasing block size
Image credit: Joshua Lim
The first and most straightforward solution is to increase block size.
Going back to the train analogy, this means increasing the train’s seating capacity from 10 to, say, 20 people. This way, the train can transport more passengers at a go and reduce congestion at the station.
The current block size for bitcoin is 1 MB per block. Bumping that up to 2 MB per block can double the number of transactions processed per second. The bigger the block size, the higher the number of transactions processed per second.
But this is problematic in practice.
As Jia of Zilliqa explains, “Say you increase the block size from 1 MB to 1 GB. The problem is that when you create the block, you have to send it to other people in the network.”
He continues, “If you use Gmail, you’ll know that when you upload a file that big, Google starts complaining. The network just can’t process that huge a file that quickly. That’s the problem with increasing the block size. You can’t go beyond a certain block size, so there’s a limit to how this solution can scale.”
2. Off-chain solutions
Image credit: Joshua Lim
The second possibility is through off-chain solutions, like the Lightning network for Bitcoin, Raiden network for Ethereum, and Trinity for Neo.
With current methods, every time you make a transaction, it has to be approved by every node in the network. (A node is a computer that runs the algorithms to process the transactions.)
For example, you’d like to buy a cup of coffee from a particular cafe every day for a month. The coffee costs $1, but you don’t want to burden the entire network for a $1 transaction. Making a daily $1 transaction on the network is very costly.
So you sign a contract with the cafe owner. The contract states that every day, you’ll pay for your cup of coffee with a token worth $1. After 30 days, the owner can exchange these 30 tokens for $30 on the network. You send one transaction to the network to mark the start of this contract. To mark the end of the contract, you send another after 30 days. The owner then exchanges his tokens for $30 in cash from the network.
Because these are private agreements that happen outside the blockchain network, they’re called off-chain solutions.
The drawback of this system is that the process will be centralized around the servers hosting these off-chain transactions. These off-chain networks are also black boxes, and the transparency and security of of this solution is questionable.
3. Delegated consensus protocol
Image credit: Joshua Lim
Processing transactions on the blockchain network is currently slow because every node in the network has to process every transaction. So if there are a thousand nodes in the network, then all of them would have to process every transaction made in that network.
It’s as if you have a group of 1,000 people, and each person has to agree on something. Not only will the process be lengthy, but it will also be very messy.
Instead, what if you pick 10 members from the community, appoint them as governing members of the group, and let these 10 people make a vote? It’ll be much easier and faster for them to reach a consensus.
Similarly, you can delegate a group of nodes to run the protocol and agree on transactions. Their agreement will be taken as representative of the consensus of the group.
Most scalable blockchain projects are using this protocol. To get into the “governing body” or consortium, members of the group will have to register their interest and undergo certain tests (called proof of stake, or proof of authority). If they succeed, they will be given a certificate to join the consortium and run the consensus protocol.
The trouble with this, however, is that the protocol now becomes centralized around the delegated group of nodes that run it.
4. Sharding
Image credit: Joshua Lim
This is where sharding – an on-chain solution that divides the network into “shards” – comes in.
Sharding is not a new concept in the domain of databases. Sharding separates large databases into smaller, faster, more easily manageable parts called data shards.
The concept had never been applied to blockchain until Loi Luu, Prateek Saxena, and their team explored it in their research paper Elastico. An assistant professor at the School of Computing at the National University of Singapore, Saxena is also Zilliqa’s chief scientific advisor. Luu, who works for the company as an advisor, was a PhD student at the same university when the paper was written.
Zilliqa’s solution is called network sharding.

To illustrate how it works, imagine that you have a five-step problem.

Now you are in a classroom of 10 students. You have this problem, and the steps can be solved in parallel. You divide the class into five groups of two students, and get each group to solve each of the subtasks. The first group will solve the first subtask, the second group will solve the second subtask, and so on.

Once a group is done with its subtasks, it passes the information over to the teacher. The teacher will aggregate the answers from the five groups and pass the full set of information to all the groups. This way, all the participants get to know what each group was working on, even if they had no idea what the others were doing while they were focused on their subtasks.
The students in this example are nodes on the Zilliqa platform. The “class” consists of all the nodes in the network, and the “groups” are called shards. The “teacher” represents the Directory Service (DS) Committee, which is a shard in itself.
Compare this to a classroom on the bitcoin network, where students have to solve every step of the problem on their own. This approach takes much longer and is a lot more taxing on each participant.
Using Zilliqa’s networking sharding, if you had 10,000 nodes, they will be randomly divided into 10 groups via a process called proof of work. Each group is called a shard.

Every shard will process a different set of transactions and come up with a set of transactions they all agree upon. They then report a digest of these transactions to another shard called the DS Committee, which will aggregate such digests from the different groups, and combine them to form a larger entity called the final block. Information from the final block will be sent back to all groups.
This process is called network sharding, and Zilliqa is the only company known to be working on it at the moment. Network sharding is a decentralized, secure on-chain solution that gives you linear scalability — that is, the more nodes you have, the higher the throughput you get. Zilliqa can currently process 2,488 transactions per second, and is aiming to get to 10,000 transactions per second in future.
Ethereum is working on a similar but different process called state sharding. In network sharding, not every node has to process every transaction, but every node will have to store information about what’s going on in other shards in the network. But with state sharding, every node will only store the subset of the information they’ve processed. While this reduces the burden of each node, communication between shards gets complicated.
However, the downside of sharding is the complexity of the design and implementation.
“We started our research in 2015, and are still running experiments for sharding,” observes Jia. “It’s simple to implement a naive version of sharding, but difficult to do it correctly and securely. This is why so few teams are working on it.”
“Compare this with the idea of increasing the block size,” he says. “That’s the simplest solution. You only have to tune one parameter. Increase the block size, and you increase the throughput. When you introduce sharding, there are so many other things we need to think about. How do you properly select each group member? How do you split the tasks? All these bring complexity to the system. But if done correctly, your system will be decentralized, secure, and give a linear throughput.”
Bandwidth and storage will also be common downsides – not just for sharding, but for all scalable blockchain solutions.
This is not yet a problem for popular blockchain platforms like bitcoin and ethereum because of their low throughput.
“Bitcoin and ethereum process 10 transactions per second,” says Jia. “At the current rate, all transactions in a year will amount to a few GB. But when we tackle tens or hundreds of millions of transactions a day, there will be an explosion of data, and in order to store all those transactions, we’ll have to find a better storage solution. This is something that network sharding does not solve directly.”
Running public tests
Network sharding has been successfully implemented internally at Zilliqa.
The team would now like the public to try it out on their testnet, which will be out at the end of March.
A testnet is basically a duplicate system for the team to run and test the platform before deploying it as a production system, called the mainnet.
Trial of Zilliqa on the testnet is targeted at supporters of Zilliqa – including developers and community members interested in the protocol – as well as blockchain developers interested in the concept of sharding.
In the testnet, users can observe the status of the blockchain system, such as the number of translations being processed and the current epoch number. In the meantime, users can use wallets to create valid accounts to send and receive transactions in test tokens.
Goals

In the near future, Zilliqa is planning to launch its blockchain system and smart contract platform, which will enable the running of applications on the blockchain. Next in line is the release of anchor applications – called decentralized applications, or dApps for short – on the platform. Think of these as applications like Google and Facebook, but released on a decentralized blockchain platform. These apps can push Zilliqa into mainstream usage.
“If a blockchain is an operating system, we want Zilliqa to become the Android or iOS of the future,” says Jia. “We hope that ordinary people will be able to use and develop dApps easily, and someday notice that their favorite apps are built on Zilliqa.”
In future, Zilliqa is also looking to solve open problems in blockchain, such as scalable solutions, privacy, and storage.
“These are problems not just for the industry, but for academia,” says Jia. “In the long term, we would like to provide a scalable blockchain platform. At the same time, we also want to do research, publish papers, and support the blockchain industry so that we can resolve these open problems and build the internet of the future.”

Over the past few years, Singapore has seen the birth of several fintech startups that are using automation and AI to replicate the role of human financial advisors, helping users to preserve and grow their wealth through passive investing.
With lower fees than banks and fund managers, these robo-advisors reckon they can make more money for their users than their offline competitors. But the more pressing question for them and their backers is, how can they can make money for themselves while operating with razor-thin margins?
One of this new crop of robo-advisors, StashAway, announced today that it has raised US$5.3 million in its series A round.
Most of the investors were not disclosed, though the startup said that a group of family offices – including that of former Temasek executive and Asia Capital & Advisors founder Francis Rozario – and one new investor participated in the round.
This latest capital injection brings StashAway’s total funding to date to US$8.4 million across three funding rounds.
StashAway co-founder and CEO Michele Ferrario – a former group CEO at ecommerce platform Zalora – told Tech in Asia that the fresh funding will be used to improve its service through further development of its AI tech.
The capital will also help StashAway launch in one new market in the Asia-Pacific region later this year.
Making money
Robo-advisors claim their competitive advantages over human-managed mutual funds (also known as unit trusts) and established automated investment options like exchange-traded funds is their substantially lower fees, and the ease of use they offer through mobile app or desktop-based interfaces.
With teams of human professionals making investment decisions for clients, mutual fund managers have high overheads compared to robo-advisors. They’ll typically charge fees worth 2 to 3 percent of the initial investment, according to Kenneth Lou, CEO at personal finance site Seedly.
In comparison, robo-advisors make investment decisions based on modeling and algorithms, allowing them to charge 0.5 to 1 percent fees.
Lou found that StashAway was generally the most costly robo-advisor in Singapore in terms of fees when he compared it to two competing startups, AutoWealth and Smartly.
However, StashAway claims to be the only one that requires a zero minimum balance from users.
“At the end of the day, consumers are making a decision on what is the best investment product, not on the fact that an annual fee is just a little bit lower or the interface looks nice,” said Ferrario. “With that said, no robo-advisor will win with just having lower fees, no lock-in period, or a low minimum balance.”
In Ferrario’s opinion, what sets StashAway apart from the competition is its proprietary investment methodology, which is focused on risk management. As he explained, “This isn’t different just to [other] Singapore robo-advisors, but we are arguably the only robo-advisor in the world offering this level of investment sophistication to both retail and accredited investors.”
He added, “This isn’t to say that we won’t have drawdowns, but by reading macroeconomic data, the technology manages the portfolios so that the ups and downs aren’t nearly as severe.”
Nevertheless, fees remain – for now – the only source of income for StashAway. Just how it and other robo-advisors can generate additional revenue and move towards profitability remains unclear.
“With that in mind, it goes without saying that this is a business model that requires us to really scale,” said Ferrario. “As a result, we’ve invested a lot into tech and our team to build the best product in the space. It’s going to take time, but we’re doing all the right things, and are exceeding our projections.”

Growth-stage venture capital and private equity firm Insight Venture Partners, an investor in several high-profile software-as-a-service (SaaS) companies like Shopify, NewRelic, and Wix, today revealed its first investment in India: subscription billing software-maker Chargebee.
The New York-based investor led Chargebee’s US$18 million series C round of funding, in which existing investors Accel Partners and Tiger Global Management participated. Insight, which has raised over US$18 billion in capital, has invested in more than 300 companies worldwide, including Hootsuite, Flipboard, Twitter, JD, and Alibaba. Chennai-based Chargebee caught its eye at the SaaStr conference in San Francisco a year ago.
Analysts from Insight referred a few of their portfolio companies as prospective customers for Chargebee. “They used our product, were happy with it, and that was a good way for the fund to validate us,” Krish Subramanian, co-founder and CEO of Chargebee, tells Tech in Asia.
“As a firm, we are long on recurring revenue businesses. Chargebee is poised to capitalize on this trend,” Harley Miller, vice president at Insight, who will be joining the Chargebee board, said in a press announcement.
While the earlier funding rounds for Chargebee were more of a bet on the subscription billing market and the founders, the latest is based on the company’s growth metrics, Subramanian shares. That’s something he and his co-founders – Rajaraman Santhanam, K.P. Saravanan, and Thiyagarajan T. – are proud of.
Founded in 2011, Chargebee’s software makes implementing subscription billing and recurring payments easier for small and medium-sized businesses (SMB). It claims to have over 7,000 customers in 53 countries.
Subscription economy
Around the world, a subscription economy is catching on. Anything from software on the cloud to milk and eggs can be delivered on monthly subscriptions. That’s why even legacy software companies like Microsoft and Adobe are trying to transform themselves with new services offered on subscription.
As billing and accounting are crucial pieces of any business, many want to build their own in-house software. But financial service software is complex and requires specialization, given all the compliance requirements involved, including taxes, privacy issues, and data protection laws. For most companies, that would be a substantial investment away from their core business.
“For example, Amazon Web Services is so cost-effective that you don’t have to build infrastructure in-house anymore. We look at billing similarly,” Subramanian says. “Our core value proposition is that you want to grow your business, and so you don’t want to do anything but your core business in-house. That is where a plug-and-play billing system like ours will help you scale your business.”

Big rival? No problem!
Three days ago, Silicon Valley-based Zuora – which, like Chargebee, provides billing and other financial services to companies with recurring revenues – filed for an IPO on the New York Stock Exchange. It reported an annual revenue of around US$168 million and a net loss of around US$47 million in its last fiscal year.
But, in a way, that’s good news for Subramanian and team. “Zuora going public is a great validation for the overall space and for us that the market exists. It is a 10-year-old product going after SAP, Oracle, and the likes,” he says, adding that subscription billing is still a largely untapped market. “We don’t have to be the first to market.”
In its S-1 filing, Zuora noted that it serves about 950 customers globally and is going after bigger enterprises. It pegs the market opportunity for its core billing and revenue recognition products at US$9.1 billion by 2022, growing at 35 percent annually. Though it clocks subscription revenue of around US$120 million in a year, Zuora’s “professional services” revenue is growing at a much faster rate.
“The way we differentiate ourselves is in terms of the total cost of ownership, with a faster implementation cycle and products that fit like a glove. We think of ourselves as a Stripe for subscription billing, where we deliver solutions that a developer can easily consume without external services help, implement in weeks, go live, and start making money,” Subramanian says. He points out that Chargebee’s billing system takes less than a week to implement compared to Zuora’s, which requires onboarding, training, professional services, and so on.
Tech in Asia checked out reviews about Zuora on HackerNews for comparison.
Apart from Zuora, Chargebee competes with Recurly, BillQuick, FuseBill, Chargify, and others. It also competes with several internal billing systems where businesses build their own software on top of Stripe or Braintree.
But rivals are not what’s keeping the founders on their toes. “Our biggest challenge is to make sure that we continue to build a product that keeps pace with our customers’ growth,” Subramanian says.
For example, Singapore startup GuavaPass now operates in eight countries. It recently launched in China, and Chargebee had to rush to enable WeChat and Alipay as payment methods. “We had to get out there fast enough and enable them,” says Subramanian.
Customers speak
Chargebee and a big chunk of its customers have grown alongside each other. India’s best-known SaaS startup Freshworks is an example. Chargebee began powering its first product, Freshdesk, in 2011, when it had less that 500 paying customers. Today, Freshworks has around 150,000 paying customers across its seven products.
Denver-based Craftsy, which sells videos of crafts classes, craft supplies, and kits, was also built on Chargebee’s billing software. It was acquired by NBC Universal last year. For NBCU, Craftsy opens up a new revenue stream.
Such new revenue streams of big businesses is another segment that Chargebee is going after, besides those with a subscription model right from their inception. “We steer away from large-scale transformational enterprise projects,” Rajaraman says.
Another key strategy that worked for Chargebee was its decision to test the quality of sales leads that came its way, using pricing as a filter. Chargebee as a billing system is not for freelancers or individual consultants who can use a regular invoicing system to do recurring billing.
“While pricing our product at US$99, we are deliberately filtering out people who are looking at a comparable US$15 product. We want to be spending all our energy focusing on the right segment we want to grow,” Subramanian says.
The latest funding round takes Chargebee’s total capital raised to US$24.7 million. Subramanian declined to reveal revenue figures.

54,"Today, we are very excited to announce our first-ever partnership with a blockchain company – Tomochain!
Founded by Long Vuong and his team, Tomochain aims to solve the scalability issues of the Ethereum blockchain. It is compatible with Ethereum’s smart-contracts and other Ethereum protocols, while keeping the confirmation time low, and fees minimal. You can learn more about them via its website and whitepaper.
This partnership will see Tech in Asia’s Branded Content team crafting a series of thoughtful and insightful pieces for Tomochain. I am also pleased to be joining Tomochain as an advisor to assist Vuong in setting up a strong foundation for the company over the next 12 months, in areas including culture, HR, and product management.
Tech in Asia will be receiving Tomocoins and Ether in exchange for our services. We have also updated our statement of ethics to make known that we are working and holding Tomocoin.
With these disclosures in place, I’d like to share more why we are excited to work with Vuong and Tomochain.
Vuong has a firm conviction and clear vision for the “Internet of Value” which he shared in this article. Reading Vuong’s piece triggers us to rethink the concept of money and how technology can play a part to improve the status quo. Through our discussions, it was clear to me that he and his team started Tomochain to fulfill their “Internet of Value” vision.
To make his vision a reality, Vuong also acknowledged that the health of the blockchain community is critical to the success of people who are working and/or trading in the blockchain scene. We believe that the blockchain community is in its early days, and that a lot of groundwork will be required to ensure we bring more credibility and stability to the ecosystem.
Helping to build the blockchain ecosystem is of course aligned to Tech in Asia’s mission, and there’s a lot of work to be done. It’s a familiar journey we have been through before. Some of the things we discussed with Vuong and team include – How can we expand the blockchain talent pool? What more can we do to support good blockchain projects? How can blockchain technology go mainstream and be truly useful in daily lives? Many of these questions cannot be answered overnight. The groundwork is being laid though, and we are excited to play a part, however big or small.
Vuong articulated these thoughts very aptly in his piece:

  […] many are laying its groundwork: engineers are writing software and building its future infrastructure, writers and journalists are learning and writing more about its challenges and opportunities, and lawmakers are trying to understand its implications. […] Everyone who wishes to can play a role.

Our sincere thanks to Tomochain for believing in us, and here’s to a very fruitful partnership!

Asia loves food, so it’s no surprise that online food delivery is one of the region’s biggest tech sectors.
Among the fastest-growing markets is Thailand, where the food-delivery industry has more than doubled in size over the past four years. Worth US$463 million in 2014, food delivery in the Land of Smiles is projected to hit US$1.02 billion in orders by the end of 2018, according to research consultancy Euromonitor International.
That’s why Malaysian ready-to-eat food delivery startup Dahmakan has just acquired Bangkok-based competitor Polpa, marking its first foray into the Thai market.
Much like Dahmakan itself, Polpa is a vertically integrated, “full-stack” food-delivery service. It designs its own menus, runs its own kitchens, and prepares its own food, which it then delivers on demand.
Polpa has achieved positive unit economics through a super-efficient production and delivery system.
Dahmakan will integrate its logistics and operations tech, including an AI-driven delivery routing system and order prediction tool, with Polpa’s platform in the coming weeks. Android and iOS apps for Polpa – which currently only accepts orders through its website – will also be launched in the near future.
Dahmakan didn’t disclose financial details of the acquisition, but co-founder and chief operating officer Jessica Li told Tech in Asia that Polpa co-founders Julian Timings and Prongfa Uennatornaranggoon will join Dahmakan’s executive team and become shareholders as a result of the deal.
Li claimed that Polpa is among the biggest ready-to-eat delivery players in Bangkok, in terms of daily meals delivered and growth rate, and that it has been profitable since it launched in 2014.
“We were impressed with both the brand and traction that the Polpa team has. Polpa has achieved positive unit economics through a super-efficient production and delivery system, which impressed us a lot,” said Li.

She added that Dahmakan expects Bangkok to become its fastest-growing market, with Polpa’s revenue projected to increase five times during its first year of operations as a Dahmakan subsidiary.
She confirmed that Polpa had not received any venture funding prior to today’s acquisition.
According to web analytics service Similarweb, Polpa’s site averaged 9,781 monthly visits between December 2017 and February 2018, with less than 5,000 monthly unique visitors (individuals who visited the site at least once in a month). Foodpanda’s Thai site clocked 290,359 monthly visits and 121,878 monthly unique visitors over the same timeframe.
Buying into the market
Polpa’s similar business model made it a sensible, synergistic acquisition target for Dahmakan, which signaled its intention to enter the promising Thai market when it announced it had become the first Malaysian startup to join the Y Combinator (YC) accelerator program in August last year.
(Disclosure: Tech in Asia is also a YC company. See our ethics page for details.)
Dahmakan has apparently been successful in its home market, with Li reporting fourfold growth in annual revenue. At the time of its YC entry, the startup said it expected to be profitable by the middle of this year. When asked if Dahmakan was still on track to hit this projection, Li said it has “already achieved positive unit economics.”
Despite the positive traction in Malaysia, Dahmakan’s decision to acquire a competitor in Thailand, rather than enter the market itself and build a business from scratch, makes plenty of sense.
Thailand’s US$1 billion-plus potential means fierce competition. Food-delivery marketplace models like those offered by Foodpanda, Line’s Line Man, and Uber’s UberEats are already active in Bangkok. Singapore-based ride-hailing giant Grab also offers a delivery service in Thailand, as does Vietnamese startup Foody.
Grab and Uber’s Indonesian rival Go-Jek has also indicated it will expand to Thailand and other Southeast Asian countries this year, bringing its Go-Food delivery service with it.

By buying Polpa, Dahmakan almost immediately obtains a recognized, trusted brand that is already fulfilling orders and making money. It doesn’t have to expend the same resources on brand building, hiring, and other overheads that it would if it built its own Bangkok business from the ground up.
As such, it’s not surprising to hear from Li that other acquisitions or collaborations with local players may be in the pipeline, as Dahmakan eyes its next expansion targets – Hong Kong and Jakarta – for later this year.
“Where there is an existing business in our target market who is aligned, we will partner with them to provide our technology and support them to scale quickly. We are definitely seeing a lot more of acquisitions happening internationally in the food delivery space and the advantages of such partnerships,” she said.

Dahmakan did not disclose the precise amount of funding it received from YC when it entered the program last August, but revealed today it had banked US$2.6 million from the US accelerator and other investors including Atami Capital, Texas Atlantic Capital, and a former CEO of Nestle Germany.
Along with a US$1.3 million seed round in February 2017, the startup has secured over US$4 million in funding – and that’s before it has even raised a series A round, which Li indicated is around the corner.
